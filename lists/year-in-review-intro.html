                <p>These pages are summaries of the games I've played each year, as well as other gaming-related events in my life. Again, this doesn't include every single game, but the goal is to include everything I write a review for. They include a summary of the year, lists of games played that will have a review, and any stray thoughts that I wanted to write down but felt didn't belong in a distinct review. I like to list the games in rough chronological order of when I played them.</p>
