# 2025 Gaming Year in Review

2025 has so far been mostly a year where I've been making good on actually playing some of the retro games (including hacks!) that I spent parts of 2024 pursuing the perfect setup for. Since I don't usually log those in the same way, it looks a bit like a lighter year for gaming than it actually was. But it has been light on _modern_ games.

## Game List

- The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (beaten)
- Donkey Kong 64 (quit at final boss with 92% completion)

## Top Picks

TBD

## Stray Thoughts

This might be a longer stray thoughts than usual, since I played a lot of short retro games through or near to completion. I didn't want to leave them unacknowledged, but there isn't a lot to say to warrant a full review. First up is **Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge**, which I played since I was in a bit of a Banjo mood after playing a BK ROMhack. I had low expectations and didn't love it, but aside from the sometimes confusing isometric perspective, it's mostly just more boring than anything. The isometric view does a better job of closely replicating the 3D gameplay, but I think a sidescroller would've been more interesting to go back to.

Keeping with the (sort-of) N64 theme, **Rocket: Robot on Wheels** surprised me with its more physics-oriented style of platforming that also includes vehicles. There were even levels where you can build a rudimentary rollercoaster, and change the color of a lot of the scenery with a tank. Those were both early on, and it started to impress me less as I continued forward, but nonetheless it's a a worthwhile hidden gem on the N64 that feels a bit ahead of its time.

On the NES, **Ducktales** proved to be a bit underwhelming as far as commonly-cited top NES games go. The music is great and the graphics solid, and the cane bouncing as well as branching paths in levels are nice, but overall it's a bit simplistic and short, artificially lengthened by limited continues rather than more levels. **Rygar** was a surprisingly good proto-Metroidvania, with thanks to save states so I didn't have to play in one sitting as originally designed. At a glance it seems like a poor game - the graphics and music are pretty bland, and the randomly spawning enemies can be annoying, but it has some neat stuff going on. The platforming based around climbing and sliding on ropes is something different, awkward controls aside, and it generally just isn't as hostile to the player as games of its day; for example, it provides healing items near the final boss and you have the option to easily level up through generous EXP. Next up, **Little Samson** was sort of the opposite of Rygar, in that it is a flashy looking game that isn't as good as it feels like it should be. The closest thing I can think of that it's like is Mega Man, but with switchable characters, and more but shorter levels. It looks really good (Samson's twirling jump is cool), but the music being per-character instead of per-stage is a curious choice. Many of the unique character abilities are pretty impressive, but also make character choice not all that interesting of a decision. Overall, the game is solid to good, but I just found the levels to be shorter than I'd like, and a bit lacking in a strong identity (both visually and mechanically).
