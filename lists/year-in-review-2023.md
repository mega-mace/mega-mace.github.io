# 2023 Gaming Year in Review

2023 will probably go down as one of the best years ever in gaming, but like pretty much every year for the past decade, I spent a lot of my gaming time on seemingly endless massive backlog instead. I've had a tendency to be a generation or two behind, but as the current generation tends to move slowly (at least until this year), there has been a bit of time to catch up, as well as time to let go entirely of some of those games that have been buried in the backlog for years. 

This is also a time when companies have been leaning more than ever into subscription-based gaming, much to my chagrin. I had a bit of a subscription game blitz, first with my expiring PlayStation Plus after I decided not to renew due to the price increase, and then a three month Game Pass trial. 

Nonetheless, even by my standards it was a big year for new games in 2023. First I got a remake of what's probably one of my top 10 games of all time. And then just a couple months later, I got the game that was destined to be not just my 2023 GotY but the best game I played in 2023 period.

## Stray Thoughts

This year I managed to snag a Nintendo DS with games for $15 at Goodwill, which is the kind of thrift store find you so seldom find anymore that I had to document my excitement. Most of the games in there weren't major ones, but it did include Mario Kart DS and New Super Mario Bros. MKDS was interesting for a bit, mostly because of the little challenges, which I recall is sadly not a concept they kept around by MK8. I played a world of NSMB but not any further since I've already played it through before. Then there's Picross DS, which I had to buy separately, but was the perfect length (only doing up to 10x10s) for some diversions on a flight. For some reason I enjoyed playing a simpler console even though I could have easily played my Switch. That's about the extent of my DS experimentation, but it rekindled an interest in possibly revisiting more of this console in the future.
