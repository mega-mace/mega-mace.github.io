# 2024 Gaming Year in Review

2024 is another year with a few new games that interested me, but mostly spent on my backlog as usual. This year I reached _way_ back, getting back into retro gaming. Sort of. I bought a CRT again, bought one of those retro handhelds that there are dozens of now (and quickly resold it after not being satisfied), and experimented with several other emulation setups. 

Turns out, the _concept_ of retro games and the technology to play them is often more appealing than actually playing them. I did my share of trying games out, but a lot of them I didn't play that long or there just isn't much to say. One thing I took an interest in is hacking and homebrews, although I've barely scratched the surface with that. I _did_ spend a lot of time making a ROMhack myself, but it will probably be years before it's done (if ever).

This is also a year I downsized my collection a bit through eBay sales, not so much for the money or physical space, but the mental space. Sometimes, you've gotta let go of games you probably won't play anymore. Plus in the era of remasters, not to mention emulation again, there are many games that are never truly gone. In spite of this, I did replay a higher number of games this year compared to 2023, although that was in part _because_ I planned to sell them (whether or not I ultimately did).

## Top Picks

For my favorite game played in 2024, I can't decide between FF7 Rebirth and Astro Bot, which are both on fairly opposite ends of the spectrum about what makes games great. Other favorites, in no particular order: Titanfall 2, Half-Life and Halo 3.

## Stray Thoughts

On the newer game front, I played a couple games because of my expiring Nintendo Switch Online. First, the **Mario Kart 8 Booster Course DLC** was mostly a reminder of what a great game MK8 is and how good it feels to race (when some bad luck frustration doesn't happen). Overall the pack was pretty fun, but not up to par with the base game, with the reliance on real-world based Tour courses feeling a little out of place. It was interesting to see that many of the courses had changing routes each lap, perhaps foretelling a key design gimmick for MK9?

Then I had to give **Super Mario Maker 2** one more go. It's a shame that the first already sapped a lot of my creative energy, because I liked checking out most of the few levels I did make in 2, especially after they added Link to the game. Coincidentally, I also revisited the first because I needed to hook up my Wii U, and it was a bit humbling going back to my own creations. It was always frustrating to pour hours into perfecting a level only to get bad numbers on it. But playing many of them years later, with (almost) fresh eyes that have forgotten both the tricks of the level and the pain of making it, it was easier to see that some I made just weren't very good.

As for retro games, aside from the few here I documented separate reviews for, I played a lot of homebrews. Probably the only one particularly worth mentioning, even though it is just a Tetris clone, is **From Below**. It has a twist where a Kraken will appear from the bottom of the screen and push one column of blocks up, either with a timer or after a number of turns, based on the mode you choose. It's pretty professional looking, although given that fact, I was disappointed that the blocks weren't a bit more colorful and that the music is limited. An option to press select to hold a piece would've also been nice. Speaking of Tetris, I'm generally game to check out any iteration even if they're all the same thing, but **Tetris DS** was a nice find with its extra game modes that take advantage of both the touch controls and two screens. There is also a heavy lean on theming from classic Nintendo games. Lastly, I dabbled in the **Mega Man Game Boy** games, which were weird mixes of their NES counterparts, but number V stood out as one maybe worth checking out in detail, as that is finally a fully original one.
