# My Top 100 Games of All Time, By Year

In 2023, I decided to create a list of my top 100 games ever, but instead of a strict ranking, it is a list by year. I liked doing it by year because it eliminates those questions like whether an old game aged well, or on the other side, whether the inclusion/exclusion of a recent game is (anti-) recency bias. It also gets rid of the headache of evaluating games on the margins. Is the hypothetical 105th best game ever really _that_ much less deserving than the 92nd game that did make the cut?

Evaluating games against their contemporaries is a little simpler, but by no means was this still an easy task. I imposed a minimum of one game and a maximum of five per year before I started making my picks, and was somewhat surprised to find a few years being hard to narrow down while other years were hard to decide on a worthy pick. This covers 1985-2023, mostly because the NES era is the earliest one I still find broadly tolerable (but I have played and liked a handful of games that are older). I stopped at 2023 because if I added any more, then I'd have to start ranking between eras to keep it at 100. If you find some choices on here puzzling, just know that I'll never be fully satisfied with it myself either, but I had to finalize it at some point. I will call attention to especially great games I played after the list is completed, but they just won't be ranked "officially". 

Some of my other rules for picking entries were:

- Only official releases (no fan games, ROMhacks, etc.)
- Year is determined by original release date for earliest released region
- DLC, expansions, remasters, etc. can factor into my evaluating the quality of a game, even if they came in a later year.
    - More full-scale remakes are an exception to this and count as a separate game
