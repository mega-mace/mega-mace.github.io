## Dark Souls

Arguably the most influential game series of the decade, somehow I never really heard all that much about Souls games for a long time. Even when I finally did play this, I'm not entirely sure I "got" it. On the surface it seems like a pretty simplistic third-person action RPG, yet it's hard to think of notable predecessors that were similar. Fundamentally it's just about fighting things and trying to stay alive, and has a lot of your RPG staples: various melee combat options, bows and magic spells. Where it gets a little more novel is with the stamina system, dodging and parrying. The other big deal is the progression system, with your souls that go towards leveling being lost upon death.

When Souls games are described this way, they don't sound all that compelling, and sometimes I'm still not sure they _are_, but I would not intentionally sell them short. The difficulty is of course important, but beyond cliche to mention. But I don't even think it's that they're fun because they are difficult, but rather what said difficulty represents, which is why it landed on the list.

Dark Souls and company are games seemingly made to please no one in particular, and yet that's why they have gained an audience. In an increasingly large industry where big budget developers constantly chase established trends, looking for a safe bet, From Software is simply making a humble _game_. They eschew flashy cutscenes, celebrity stunt casts, endless collectables, and so on; the things that don't always make a game _bad_, but rarely make one _good_. If they are going to alienate a player, it will be because of a game mechanic. And sometimes the game mechanics aren't great, maybe even border on unfair, but it's an admirable move. It's understated in today's industry, yet in a way is far bolder than the race for the biggest Hollywood spectacle or largest map to dump content in.

I'm still a bit overcome with the idea these games aren't really for me. I tend to play things just to see the story one time (or in the case of a Souls game, more so the incredible world design), but these are designed to be played multiple times. There are of course different builds you can try but there's also a learning curve to timing your moves and managing stamina. It's mechanically pretty rich for the dedicated, or something you can just grind through a bit like me. It's hard to say if this is the best one (as I need to play many of the others), but as the first one I played it'll always stick out in my mind.

## Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin

After playing Dark Souls 2, it's not hard to see why it's considered a black sheep in the series. There is a lot of stuff that's still good here, but something about the experience just feels off. At the start I quickly noticed things that recalled a regression back to Demon's Souls: having a central area to level up, consumable healing items at the start, and losing some of your max health upon death. You eventually build up your flasks, and you don't lose _much_ health each time (and it's easier to restore), so it's not as annoying as Demon's, but it just doesn't make sense to go back to things that were happily absent in Dark Souls 1. The central leveling is a blessing and a curse, because you get bonfire fast travel very early, but you lose that sense of traversal and connectedness in the world.

I defeated the first boss of the game without taking damage, which is an appropriate tone-setter. I think I defeated more bosses in DS2 on my first blind run than I might have in all the other Soulslikes I've played combined. Is it an easier game than usual, or did I just stumble upon a broken build? Coming off Elden Ring as my last played, one thing that's for sure is the boss move sets are so much simpler, but that would probably be the case if I were to go back to DS1 as well. I definitely think something is off here though. For instance, there's a lack of "miniboss" enemies. Instead DS2 tends to opt for trying to take you down with gangs of small enemies, which is more annoying and less fun than outduelling a single powerful one.

There are some interesting experimental touches to DS2. In particular, the petrified journeyers and the Pharros contraptions show interesting potential, but they are undermined by being tied to rare consumable items. The more boring but fleshed-out mechanic is the torch, which is a much simpler management of resources since it can be a loot drop. One of the highlights of DS2 for me was a boss where you can light the arena ahead of time to give you an advantage. Most of the time the torch "puzzle" sections are an adequate little addition to the series, but I definitely sensed an over-reliance on it by the end.

Above all else, DS2 is just lacking in compelling areas to traverse through. I will say it is about on par with other entries in terms of how things are laid out to make you think about obtaining loot in the distance, exploring from a different angle, etc. The problem is that it doesn't linger on most of its areas long. DS1 had so many places I remember, sometimes from being stuck trying to get through, but memorable nonetheless. Everyone knowss Anor Londo, Sen's Fortress and Blighttown, and that's just a few. DS2 has maybe two or three areas of that scope TOTAL, but it's mostly a jump between small 1-2 bonfire-sized zones.

What does DS2 do right? Not get in its own way with regards to having the basics down. I'm pretty sure there are also a few, _little_ quality of life improvements over DS1. But in the bigger picture, like the enemies, bosses and levels, it's hard not to say it's a downgrade across the board. It's a classic good game in a great series, the kind of thing you'd recommend if only it weren't attached to a name where there are plenty of better ones to choose from.

## Dead Cells

I never could get into the roguelike genre, but I did enjoy Hades - and maybe it's not fair to compare everything to it, but it did come to mind playing Dead Cells. Being a roguelite, DC at least did have a sense of meta-progression, but it's buried in a lot of repetition and tedium. The same is true of Hades, frankly, but a key difference in that is how the story and dialogue promise you more of a motivation for pushing forwards. In DC, you are a fairly nondescript shadow guy, and you do things because your video game senses tell you to, but there wasn't much going on with the story in the (admittedly limited) amount I played. The biggest effect it had on me was making me want to play Castlevania.

Ultimately I remain unsold on roguelikes because some of the same downsides I've seen before are here too. The gameplay _can_ be fun when you hit the right combinations, but it's a bit of a needle in a haystack, and once you do get something you like it can just as easily be taken away from you. You're constantly teased on areas you can go and things you can do but the game is vague about when/where/how you will reach that point. It seems more suited to someone who enjoys playing a little bit of the same game every day, which I generally am not.

## Dead Space

I am a long time fan of Resident Evil 4, but I didn't play Dead Space for the first time until much more recently. It's not totally fair to compare the two, but inevitable for me, given the clear RE4 influence in how you move and shoot, plus the weapon upgrade system. That is about where the similarities end, but it's a strong foundation for a game I was bound to enjoy playing. 

Surprisingly, I found the sci-fi themed DS to be the much scarier game of the two, as RE4 is more traditional horror, though yes, _campy_ horror. The enemies in DS are disturbing, the gore content astronomical, and Isaac's psychological torture palpable. Instead of snarking the cartoon villains, you are hunting down visions of your probably dead girlfriend while trying to make sense of the alien takeover of the vessel. A tradeoff in achieving the level of tension is that you don't feel as powerful from a gameplay standpoint. The melee and the guns were not nearly as fun or snappy as RE4, but it does give you pretty good chances to stay alive. I was also a bit letdown by the lack of variety in locations, but it was nonetheless a gripping game.

## Dead Space 2

Dead Space 2 is sort of like my previous game on this list, a sequel to a game from my Top 100 that is horror-themed and largely does a lot of the same as its predecessor. But unlike Dawn of Sorrow, I had a more enjoyable time playing it and it did a little bit more to stand out from the previous game, so it gets an honorable mention in the top 100. Overall it's hard to really find a complaint with DS2 in comparison to the first game. The core gameplay isn't changed much, but there are new weapons and enemies. A lot of things are streamlined, like finding objectives. The zero gravity controls are one huge improvement over the original, a gameplay element I realize I didn't even mention in my DS1 review, but it's something that especially makes it stand out compared to Resident Evil 4. But even in this case, it's still used pretty sparingly, as this is primarily a shooting game.

The gunplay is generally more fun than the first in my opinion, although it faces stretches where it can get a little action-heavy, particularly as the game goes on. Also, even though the bosses in DS1 weren't amazing, it was odd how they seem to opt for a lack of traditional boss fights at all, aside pretty much from the end. So maybe it's not a complete improvement over the original, but in certain areas it's at worst a bit of a wash. Likewise, it was a welcome sight to see more environmental variety, although the setting and story of the first game were arguably a little bit tighter. I was worried about Isaac speaking in this one but in hindsight it was silly to be concerned. This is an _early_ 2010s game - not late 2010s, which is when (often inappropriately) quippy protagonists became common. I think the psychological horror setting fits for a silent protagonist conceptually about as well as any could, but giving Isaac dialogue was a net positive for me in the end, even if a small one. 

## Donkey Kong (1994)

I heard good things about Donkey Kong 94, but this was a bit of a letdown. Nonetheless, I did go through the whole thing. It is arcade style, sometimes to a fault, as the precision of certain jumps that you don't have great control over can be annoying. There are differing degrees of fall damage in the game, which can lead to some trial and error unless you have a really good eye for it, as I'd often find Mario rolling out of a medium fall into an obstacle. Perhaps these sources of difficulty are necessary evils given the limited screen space, and at least it's very generous with extra lives. Where DK94 really sings is the more puzzle-y elements that are introduced, where it deviates more from the original arcade games and feels more fair. Overall it's a pretty impressive package in the limited constraints, but it also had me yearning for games that were able to break away from those constraints and lean more into the puzzle aspect.

## Donkey Kong Country Series

### Donkey Kong Country

Donkey Kong Country was a staple of visits to my friend’s house. A perfect game for two-player mode, its big innovation over Super Mario World was that you had the option to switch off between players mid-level rather than between levels. Of course, more than this, we were all fixated on the graphics, which were sort of a teaser for the 3D games that were on the horizon. Perhaps so fixated we didn’t notice that it was otherwise a pretty standard 2D platformer—maybe even a little bit below standard, when compared to games like Mario and Sonic. Nonetheless, while it might be overly simple in terms of level design, it’s inoffensive; frustration is rare outside of a few difficulty spikes and some wonky collision detection. It’s not as fun to thoroughly explore as later games, but I do still enjoy giving it a quick run-through every once in a while. The graphics and music still hold up as a highlight; the jungle and snow levels in particular are some of my favorite visuals of the SNES trilogy. And of course, Rare breathed a lot of new life and personality into a series that felt like a relic at the time, showcasing their trademark humor that would define a lot of Nintendo fans’ childhoods in the 90s.

### Donkey Kong Country 2

Though it usually scores high marks, I can’t help but always feel like DKC2 is a bit overlooked. Perhaps this reflects my own experience a bit: I played a ton of the first as a kid, but never even knew there was a second one until I approached adulthood. Maybe some of the issue is that it looks a lot like 1 visually, but can you blame Rare? Everyone loved the pre-rendered graphics! And the similar visuals and engine no doubt helped them to get this out just a year later, but in spite of all that, it is a different game entirely.

About the only questionable decision here was to toss out Donkey Kong, but Dixie Kong is fun to play as in her own right. Everything else was a big improvement. The level design is totally overhauled, with you moving in directions other than to the right, and all the new game mechanics that come with added verticality. Instead of feeling tacked on, animal buddies are essential to some levels, and helpful in finding secrets in others. The secrets are much better as well—better telegraphed (albeit some can still be pretty obtuse), better designed, and with purpose! They added an entire bonus world that you can only complete by finding all the secrets, which even culminates in a special boss fight and true ending. Speaking of which… yeah, the bosses are better too, being more level-appropriate as well as requiring much more dynamic approaches to defeat. Overall the game just plays better too, with little things like collision detection improved. Lastly, they somehow upped the ante with the soundtrack even more. If you enjoy the first DKC, it’s mandatory to play this one.

### Donkey Kong Country Returns

I remember when this was announced, Donkey Kong had somewhat disappeared from the zeitgeist outside of his party game appearances, but I was among the fans excited for the revival of a 14 year old series. They were even doing it with Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, just the way it all started. It turned out not to be the game I was really expecting, but I'm not sure why that bothered me at the time. 

Ironically for a series that first caught my attention with its innovative graphics, with the revivals I felt there was a bit too much emphasis on spectacle. It's full of wide-panning shots, foreground and background shifting and silhouette levels. For some reason this was jarring to me, but it's an understandable take on modernizing it. The level design is still great, and there are secrets to be found, but something about it seemed a little more linear and hurried. 

The bonus rooms are a bit disappointing, harkening back more to the simple arcade-style item grabs from the first game, rather than the level-appropriate challenges of 2 and 3. Now collectibles are spread out through the level, in secret areas or not. I've come to appreciate it more as that is just the new standard for linear platformers. And these are pretty minor gripes, but it does change the way progression towards bonus stages works compared to past games. But eventually, you gotta move on from the past, right? I might still place the 80s and 90s as a golden age for platformers, but modern times have provided some fresh takes that retain much of what made them great.

### Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze

There's not a whole lot to say about Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze that wasn't already said in my Donkey Kong Country Returns review. On the surface, there isn't much that's different aside from being in HD, plus the addition of some familiar faces back into the mix. There was no radical shift in some of the things that disappointed me about DKCR. But I've grown to appreciate them both more with time, particularly after playing Rayman Legends, as mentioned in that review.

DKCTF is certainly not just a retread of DKCR, as it expands upon those concepts bit by bit. It's hard to explain, but it's like the approach was to make each level about 15% bigger and more creative than they did before. It feels similar, yet adds up over time. Sometimes I'd feel a bit overwhelmed with the size of some levels, but they are broken out into many chunks, in contrast with the SNES games having a single checkpoint consistently. It took me a while to understand this is how the modern approach to platformers is often gonna be, but one thing that I was never in doubt about was the creativity in this game. Every level has its own thing going on, and they together tell a little story for the world, which is really what makes the game worth visiting in such a crowded genre.

### Additional Review

I struggled a bit for what to write on this one. This is a game in my Top 100, but it wasn't the strongest entry, and when I played it again I liked it even less. As I was jotting down notes for the entry, I realized it'd be repeating a lot of what was already said, as well as comparing it too much to the SNES games, but it is a bit hard for me not to compare them.

I think there is just something _arduous_ about Tropical Freeze, which I'm not sure was present as much with Returns. This is probably best exemplified by the boss fights, which go on for several minutes with no checkpoints or replenished partner barrels. The normal levels are broken out with checkpoints, but still quite long nonetheless. There's a degree of overly demanding precision that sort of sucks the feeling of exploration out of them. Lots of levels are collapsing around you, leaving you hopping from platform to platform - it's a showcase for the game's cool visual ideas, which are its strength, but put that spectacle aside and it's all kind of repetitive and hurried. Even the water levels I played weren't super relaxed, and had this on a smaller scale with a string of sections demanding narrow timing windows.

By the time I got about midway through this, I decided I wasn't having that much fun. It still _feels_ like it should be a top 100 game, but maybe I just wasn't in the right mood this time. Once I hit that midpoint, I opened up my old save and went to the other rocket/minecart levels that I could easily identify. This might seem contradictory, as these levels are kind of the pinnacle of frantically blazing through and trying to nail your timing, but I think it's because in comparison to a "normal" level they don't have a pretense of being relaxed. Plus there are a lot of pseudo-3D sections in those levels, which might be the highlight of the game, although I had ironically forgotten they were in it, perhaps because there aren't a ton. Could that be the future of Donkey Kong? It's hard to say, as sadly we're at ten years now without even a word about a proper new DK. If Nintendo _is_ cooking something up, and it involves the decision to move away from sidescrolling, then perhaps the wait will be worth it.

## Duke Nukem 3D

Most people think of Doom as the foremost FPS of the pre-Goldeneye, pre-Half-Life days, and while they are probably right to think so, I always bet on Duke. Now some of this does come down to availability, as despite the fact that everything runs Doom, in the 90s that wasn’t quite the case, plus I was a kid without a lot of money. At some point I ended up with the N64 port of Duke3D, and there was no Doom N64 port (although there was of course a Doom 64, a different game), so there you have it. I was aware of Doom and admired it from afar, but even if I played it more at the time, I might have still gravitated towards Duke.

Why? Sure Doom had the blood, but Duke had blood, babes _and_ badass attitude. It was of course a perfectly alluring game for a pre-adolescent boy. Mere graphic violence was fairly common by this point, but the rest was not, and gave it an extra forbidden fruit quality, even with the watered-down N64 version. Nowadays I’d like to think I’m generally above such things, or at least they aren’t of primary concern in picking out a game, but it’s regardless just fun to play. It does have some of the pitfalls of early FPS—obtuse secrets, confusing maps and just generally high difficulty—but those are also the things that make these fun to go back to. In contrast to Doom, you also have a higher range of motion and the ability to look freely. I’m not sure if it was the first FPS to have free aiming, but it’s easy to take for granted now that it wasn’t there from the start. And of course, loaded with pop culture references and irreverent humor, I’m sure I’d still notice a few new things if I were to go back to it.

## EarthBound

There’s more than meets the eye with this quirky tale about a bunch of children going around suburban America. Another game that feels out of place in the typical Nintendo fare, the Shigesato Itoi-helmed RPG, like Metroid, does have its fair share of mature themes. You meet a cult with allusions to the KKK and delve into Ness’ psyche. The final boss is… something. It is punctuated by a lot of humor, however—sometimes gently dark humor that reflects this maturity, like Ness’ overworked father only being seen as a phone. There are plenty of pop culture references and puns throughout.

Initially I disliked the lack of battle animations, but eventually grew to appreciate them. Having your battles described in writing conveys the absurdity of fighting a piece of abstract art better than animations would. Much of the game is standard RPG fare for the time: you engage in turn-based battles where you can attack, use an item or use magic; and over the course of the game they get more complicated. You go around town to town along the way, getting better weapons, doing some peculiar sidequest for someone. Of course, as is often the case with RPGs, it’s more about the story and characters, and in this case humor. There are still some unique battle mechanics, like the rolling health meters, which can really add a lot of tension. I also appreciated the way weak enemies just get wiped out instantly, instead of wasting your time loading a battle screen. Thankfully this game, though rare in its original form, was brought to the attention of much wider audiences so I could experience it.

## Elden Ring

NOTE: I decided to rewrite this review since the original one was rushed a bit. Now that I've actually beaten the game, this is my review:

Elden Ring is an instant classic that is yet also a familiar experience. There are a lot of things that make it great, but the glue that holds it all together is what's been at the core of From Software's Souls-likes. It probably didn't even need to be open world, strictly speaking - there is still that sense of a proper order to doing things, and the game does have gates to progress. The nice thing about the open world, as mentioned in my original review, is that there are many paths you can take to look for advantages, level up or just hone your skills. What I undersold in the original review is that there are many advantages that have been added or streamlined compared to previous games, such as summons, ashes of war, mixed physick, crafting and easier smithing. That's what "easy mode" is in these games, and ER probably has the most of these options, although that doesn't necessarily mean it's the easiest one.

It can take a while to get into, but the gameplay loop of trying to perfect your combat encounters is very satisfying when you hit a groove. What really impresses me in ER is the level design, with the way shortcuts and loot are teased to the player and often you need to piece together spatial clues to get to them. But again, this is something present in past FromSoft games. My opinion of ER has still raised considerably, because it executes this established formula almost perfectly. It might raise even more in the future, as playing ER itself often invoked memories of Dark Souls for me. Souls games are perhaps something like the concept of "Type II" fun - something that can be difficult in the moment, but making for fond memories, and ER is sure to have lots of memorable sequences for me. But admittedly it was also a lot of fun in the moment.

### Original Review

This is the game that made me question this whole project, as it landed here by default, being the only game I've played from this year as of this writing. There are other potential interesting releases I might get around to eventually, but I think this will be generally be remembered as a year the industry really felt the effects of Covid. Even a look at the Wikipedia page of top reviewed games for the year reveals a lot of re-releases of various forms.

Whether it would have made it onto the list regardless is hard for me to say. I put Dark Souls down for 2011, so I don't have a complete distaste for the genre. But when I played Elden Ring (keeping in mind I haven't played all the intervening entries yet), I couldn't help but feel that From Software hasn't changed much in over a decade. And really, why should they? Their games have a big following, and I'm not the core audience, even if I like them somewhat.

The big change with ER is that it is structurally open world, as it still leans on the typical FromSoft combat mechanics. The advantage of an open world is there is less rote grinding, as you can just go to a new area and gain runes that way, but in true FromSoft fashion, they are wise to the player's tricks. The bosses have so much more dynamic movesets that I had an even more difficult time than usual trying to keep up, and grinding can only save you so much.

To me, the best thing about FromSoft's approach is not the notorious difficulty but the other ways it rejects AAA norms. Their games are hard to truly hate as a result, but a certain point you have to ask yourself how much you can tolerate repeating certain sections over and over again. Many people appreciated this kind of difficulty in games of the past, but it's one thing when it's used to stretch out a four hour long game, not ones that push 100.

I don't think an easy mode is the answer, but I feel like FromSoft games tend to be about 10% harder than they need to be. Yet I see a small but loud minority who think even the _current_ difficulty of their games is too easy. I'm sure FromSoft isn't capitulating to those prideful, gatekeeping gamers specifically, but they have stuck to their guns on challenge, and as a result made some interesting experiences perhaps at the expense of a wider audience. Or at least I thought so, until ER became a true megahit. Maybe that is a result of the lean 2022, or I'm wrong and this review can be summed up as: "It's too hawwwwd!"

## Final Fantasy Series

### Final Fantasy VI (III)

Growing up, I was never really a big RPG fan—I wasn’t against them per se, but it wasn’t a genre that landed on my radar (probably due to not owning the big RPG consoles of the time, the SNES and PS1). One of many games on this list first introduced to me via the SNES Classic—and my first Final Fantasy—I could see why FF6 is often seen as the pinnacle of 2D FF games. Though at times some things feel dated, mainly the translation, they also add to the charm and mystique. I get an indescribable feeling playing classic JRPGs, which capture ideas and themes that are a mix of both foreign and familiar. 

The very core plot of FF6—madman tries to take over the world—is very simple, but there is far more to it than that. It’s about the characters you meet along the way, learning about the various factions and how they got to this point, and the crazy setpieces (everyone who has played this knows _that_ one particular famous scene). Compared to many of the more cheery, simple-minded games on this list, it explores darker themes like war, death and nihilism. With a huge ensemble cast, sometimes I admittedly lose track of the significance of everyone’s story, but the big cast gives you a lot of options. Everyone has some unique ability they can take advantage of, and over time they can also be trained up in magic. While I doubt big RPG fans would say it’s the deepest or most refined gameplay, for someone like me who had mainly played RPGs like Pokemon and Paper Mario to that point, it was fun to experiment with all of it. Oh and that soundtrack. You gotta talk about the soundtrack. I had first heard Dancing Mad outside of the game and thought it must be a remix, I was floored that this was something produced by a SNES. The whole game is full of amazing tracks, quirky moments, and… well it’s just one that needs to be played to really understand.

### Final Fantasy VII

Another one I was very late to the party on, it’s nonetheless undeniable why this is an all-time classic. Much of the game itself is not so timeless, namely the pre-rendered backgrounds, weird translation and some odd gameplay moments. When I played this, comparisons to FF6 came to mind, and this is one of those cases where a late 2D game occasionally outshines an early 3D game. It can be at times difficult to parse where to go in FF7 (even with the markers), and it’s stuffed with so many mini-games and pseudo-QTEs that sometimes add to the charm but often just don’t really work. However, I enjoyed the Materia system much more than the comparable Espers from FF6, and the battle screens look decent for the time, particularly with summons.

But the most striking jump made here was in tone and maturity. Your heroes swear and commit acts of terrorism. The main character, Cloud, fights less for justice and more for his own past. Avalanche fights for justice… aggressively, with consequences, both direct and as a result of Shinra’s exploitation of public opinion. It raises questions that apply to our real world, like what is a justifiable cost for progress and industrialization? Is peaceful resistance to corporate oppression possible in a world where complacency is rampant? 

And of course there is so much more… occasionally the story gets a bit convoluted, and some goofy things happen, but it’s a big journey with so many twists and turns. Like with FF6, I have difficulty remembering it all, but I just know it’s one of those games that makes me _feel_ something as I’m playing it. It’s a stellar example of the unique storytelling potential of video games.

### Final Fantasy VII Remake

For better or worse, this definitely was not what anybody could have been expecting for a remake of FF7. By only focusing on Midgar, I think we did get a lot out of arguably the strongest part of the story. Not everything works, as parts of the story get needlessly stretched and a few chapters are filled out with tedious sidequests. But I was impressed by how the anti-corporate and environmentalist messages weren’t sanitized and, if anything, are often even bolder. We see a more detailed depiction of the undercity class struggle; the fight between a bleak but outwardly stable corporate status quo and controversial radicalism to win over the people is very pertinent. 

The combat is much more fun than the strict turn-based (often random) battles of the original, even if at times bosses get overlong, and there is still an element of trial and error to equipping materia ahead of a fight. The voice acting is good most of the time, and especially at key times, and many of the action sequences in the cutscenes are incredible, even if it’s just flashy. I don’t think anyone would say this is some low-rent experience, regardless of anything else they may feel about it.

Overall, there is a lot I love about FF7R, but I don’t think its position is as strong as the original on my top 100. While it hits a lot of the right emotional notes, and they are typically enhanced by the modern presentation, I can’t help but feel it’s standing on the shoulders of giants here. The late game also left me worried a bit about future installments going off the rails, but I know of course those should be ranked on their own. At least for now, FF7R was a fun ride seeing the gang brought to life in a new manner, with some of the highs and lows I’ve mostly learned to accept out of absurd JRPG fantasy.

### Final Fantasy VII Rebirth

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that I had pretty clear expectations for, in that it would probably have the things I liked about FF7 Remake but also some things that I disliked. And my expectations were pretty much correct, so a lot of my sentiment towards Rebirth can be summed up with my Remake review (Top 100 Games for 2020). But just because it had a lot of those same things in place doesn't mean there wasn't a lot added.

Early on, I almost rolled my eyes seeing yellow paint climb holds, tower-climbing, quest-filled open maps and item crafting, gameplay elements that were already outdated in the 2020 predecessor that managed to avoid them. But perhaps "outdated" is a bit unfair - they are a bit cliche in AAA, but serve their purpose. Rebirth doesn't break the mold as an open world game, and arguably isn't even _that_ open world with the way it's sectioned off, but that can also strengthen it by making the sometimes checklist-y quest items managed by region. I did enjoy exploring on Chocobo even if it's just another take on a horse, but they gave them a few special abilities that were nice. 

Just like Remake, it does lean heavily on the strength of the source material, but it does avoid the very possible trap of screwing it up. There are certain times maybe it can lack in subtlety compared to the original, plus some confusing stuff, but it makes up for it with mostly good added and expanded material. 

Rebirth isn't all that revolutionary in general, but it might be a potential all-timer just for all the things it throws at you. A lot of big budget games lately either find the one thing they're good at and stick with it, or they're open world games that repeat various shallow content all over. Rebirth obviously is closer to the latter, but it's far from the worst example of tedious open world tasks, as the story payoff can often be good worldbuilding, and a lot of it is close enough to the main path. But aside from the usual open world elements, Rebirth has a lot more, and it feels like a throwback with all the minigames honoring the original's legacy. With one exception (Queen's Blood, and _maybe_ Chocobo racing), the minigames are all fun but not great, the kind of thing you'd play just for the main game objectives but not get wrapped up in otherwise. Yet I'm not sure I'd have it any other way, as it makes them just minor distractions in the game that don't demand too much of your time when you see one, though collectively add up in the experience.

Rebirth is full of silly elements aside from the minigames, and that's the charm of it. It knows when to be serious, and the themes are ever resonant. But it's not the kind of game that is so self-serious it is afraid to have too much fun at its own expense. Sometimes Rebirth moments can be a little corny, campy or gratuitous, but only within the context of themselves; they don't spoil any of the bigger picture, and it's hard to even imagine it at all without them.

## Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2

Speaking of retro revivals, the Geometry Wars series reaches back even further, vaguely recalling the visuals of Asteroids. Its origin might be one of the greatest gaming Easter eggs ever, a game-within-a-game that I originally found playing Project Gotham Racing 2. The lazy name and concept even reflect that it's a throw-in to something else. Fundamentally it's a space shooter where you shoot at shapes, and that's about it. Are they sentient floating shapes, or just aliens who were big fans of geometry? Who knows, but the important thing is there are many of them and they want you dead.

There's not much else you can say about a simple game, but the execution is terrific. The twin-stick controls are super smooth and intuitive. There are a few different modes, all of which are build around the concepts of evading and/or shooting ships as you go around, but with enough twists to keep it fun. I'm not a huge fan of classic arcade games, but Geometry Wars is one of those insanely addictive "one more try" games that proves the concept of going for a simple high score still holds water.

## Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions

I couldn't decide which Geometry Wars to put between 2 and 3, so why not both? I already talked about the history of GW in my review for GW2. That one was a nice simple arcade-esque throwback, but GW3 is more of a full-fledged game. Make no mistake, the arcade fundamentals are still there, but in this one you have a pretty sizable campaign to go through with many different levels. The big twist that allowed them to have so many variations is taking the game 3D, but not in the way one might think. It's really still a 2D twin-stick shooter, but the "plane" of the playfield is now wrapped around 3D objects, which adds an extra layer of challenge. There's not much else to it... no big story or epic moments, but a game that is just _fun_.

## Grand Theft Auto III

I’m not sure when the term “open world” came into use—it feels like a recent thing, yet I’ve seen it applied (retroactively?) to games as old as the original Zelda. Even the now-dated “sandbox” feels too recent for GTA3. Regardless, even if we didn’t know what to call it, we knew this progenitor of the modern open-world game was different. Sure, there were non-linear games with a big world, but those worlds were usually something of a hub between various towns and dungeons. In GTA, instead you were in one continuous (albeit segmented) zone; the overworld isn’t where you go between the action, it _is_ the action. While the main missions were a bit straightforward and unlock in a linear fashion, the map is dotted with all kinds of secret collectibles and side missions, down to even ad-hoc ones like the taxis and ambulances, being tied to a vehicle rather than a particular location. 

When I was a kid playing this, the most fun to me was no mission at all: pumping the game full of cheats and going on a criminal rampage, or perhaps trying some cool driving stunts, or trying to get past the barriers between islands. This was the promise of an open-world game, that it lets you take your time, do things your own way, but entice you with just enough rewards to get you to nibble away at the main content. Structurally, a lot of this was already present in the first two GTA games, which I had actually played prior to 3’s release. But the top-down nature of those already felt dated in the PS1 era, so GTA3 was also a strong endorsement of the then-next-generation, helping to fully realize this into 3D.

## Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

It’s hard to believe this sequel to GTA3 came out only a year later. Though not much different fundamentally, it brought in a brand new map, bolder casting (led by Ray Liotta), motorcycles, enterable buildings, and a far more familiar soundtrack. At the time, it wasn’t common to have this kind of celebrity casting in a video game. The portrayal of a specific period in recent past times was also something I don’t really recall much in games at the time. And while neon-soaked nostalgia is cliché these days, I recall it being a pretty early example of media taking us back to the 80s.

Unfortunately, I struggle a bit to come up with much more to say on this one. I have to admit that I’m not the biggest GTA fan, but I spent lots of time messing around in 3 and Vice City. San Andreas was also a big release at the time that I experienced mostly vicariously, but that is when I began to fall off from GTA. So this will be the last GTA entry here, and while these may not be generally considered the top two games in the series by most, they certainly captured the most amount of my time.
