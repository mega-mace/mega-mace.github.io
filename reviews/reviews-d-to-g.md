## Dark Souls

From Software's Souls games, along with its sister series and maybe even some of its clones, are among the most influential and heavily discussed games of the 2010s, yet somehow it took quite a while for them to truly land on my radar. Dark Souls was my first experience with any of it, so it will always be special, even if I don't always feel like I "get" it. The common critique with these games is they are too hard, but it's hard to hate them for that. They can be frustrating in the moment, but something about them sticks with you.

I think I avoided them for a long time because on the surface they sound like a pretty standard third-person action RPG. Fundamentally it's just about fighting things and trying to stay alive, and has a lot of your RPG staples: various melee combat options, bows and magic spells, character upgrades. Where it gets a little more novel is with the stamina system, dodging and parrying. The other big deal is the progression system, with your souls that go towards leveling being lost upon death. But as I would find out, describing the gameplay doesn't really do it justice, and you just have to play it.

The combat of these games always feels to me like it should be at least about 5% easier, and yet completely fair at the same time. The frustration is part of the cost of admission, but it makes mastery fulfilling. That's not to say it even demands mastery, as there's a degree of flexibility in being able to brute force encounters, or grinding is an option, although both come with a cost in tedium. This could easily be quite boring when put in the wrong hands, but what FromSoft excels at is incredible world design and compelling enemies. The world is dotted with little secrets, enhanced by its optional asynchronous multiplayer, that give way to a certain old-school sense of exploration.

A trend in modern gaming is being afraid to alienate players in the slightest, but taken too far, that itself can be alienating. In an increasingly large industry where big budget developers constantly chase established trends, looking for a safe bet, From Software is simply making a humble _game_. They eschew flashy cutscenes, celebrity stunt casts, endless collectibles, and so on; the things that don't always make a game _bad_, but rarely make one _good_. Most of all, and perhaps most controversially as well, they ditch hand holding and easy modes. You usually know what you're getting with a FromSoft game, and that may not be for everyone, but at least they will leave it all out there for you to judge on gameplay first and foremost, which is a lost art in today's industry.


## Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin

After playing Dark Souls 2, it's not hard to see why it's considered a black sheep in the series. There is a lot of stuff that's still good here, but something about the experience just feels off. At the start I quickly noticed things that recalled a regression back to Demon's Souls: having a central area to level up, consumable healing items at the start, and losing some of your max health upon death. You eventually build up your flasks, and you don't lose _much_ health each time (and it's easier to restore), so it's not as annoying as Demon's, but it just doesn't make sense to go back to things that were happily absent in Dark Souls 1. The central leveling is a blessing and a curse, because you get bonfire fast travel very early, but you lose that sense of traversal and connectedness in the world.

I defeated the first boss of the game without taking damage, which is an appropriate tone-setter. I think I defeated more bosses in DS2 on my first blind run than I might have in all the other Soulslikes I've played combined. Is it an easier game than usual, or did I just stumble upon a broken build? Coming off Elden Ring as my last played, one thing that's for sure is the boss move sets are so much simpler, but that would probably be the case if I were to go back to DS1 as well. I definitely think something is off here though. For instance, there's a lack of "miniboss" enemies. Instead DS2 tends to opt for trying to take you down with gangs of small enemies, which is more annoying and less fun than outduelling a single powerful one.

There are some interesting experimental touches to DS2. In particular, the petrified journeyers and the Pharros contraptions show interesting potential, but they are undermined by being tied to rare consumable items. The more boring but fleshed-out mechanic is the torch, which is a much simpler management of resources since it can be a loot drop. One of the highlights of DS2 for me was a boss where you can light the arena ahead of time to give you an advantage. Most of the time the torch "puzzle" sections are an adequate little addition to the series, but I definitely sensed an over-reliance on it by the end.

Above all else, DS2 is just lacking in compelling areas to traverse through. I will say it is about on par with other entries in terms of how things are laid out to make you think about obtaining loot in the distance, exploring from a different angle, etc. The problem is that it doesn't linger on most of its areas long. DS1 had so many places I remember, sometimes from being stuck trying to get through, but memorable nonetheless. Everyone knowss Anor Londo, Sen's Fortress and Blighttown, and that's just a few. DS2 has maybe two or three areas of that scope TOTAL, but it's mostly a jump between small 1-2 bonfire-sized zones.

What does DS2 do right? Not get in its own way with regards to having the basics down. I'm pretty sure there are also a few, _little_ quality of life improvements over DS1. But in the bigger picture, like the enemies, bosses and levels, it's hard not to say it's a downgrade across the board. It's a classic good game in a great series, the kind of thing you'd recommend if only it weren't attached to a name where there are plenty of better ones to choose from.

## Dead Cells

I never could get into the roguelike genre, but I did enjoy Hades - and maybe it's not fair to compare everything to it, but it did come to mind playing Dead Cells. Being a roguelite, DC at least did have a sense of meta-progression, but it's buried in a lot of repetition and tedium. The same is true of Hades, frankly, but a key difference in that is how the story and dialogue promise you more of a motivation for pushing forwards. In DC, you are a fairly nondescript shadow guy, and you do things because your video game senses tell you to, but there wasn't much going on with the story in the (admittedly limited) amount I played. The biggest effect it had on me was making me want to play Castlevania.

Ultimately I remain unsold on roguelikes because some of the same downsides I've seen before are here too. The gameplay _can_ be fun when you hit the right combinations, but it's a bit of a needle in a haystack, and once you do get something you like it can just as easily be taken away from you. You're constantly teased on areas you can go and things you can do but the game is vague about when/where/how you will reach that point. It seems more suited to someone who enjoys playing a little bit of the same game every day, which I generally am not.

## Dead Space

I am a long time fan of Resident Evil 4, but I didn't play Dead Space for the first time until much more recently. It's not totally fair to compare the two, but inevitable for me, given the clear RE4 influence in how you move and shoot, plus the weapon upgrade system. That is about where the similarities end, but it's a strong foundation for a game I was bound to enjoy playing. 

Surprisingly, I found the sci-fi themed DS to be the much scarier game of the two, as RE4 is more traditional horror, though yes, _campy_ horror. The enemies in DS are disturbing, the gore content astronomical, and Isaac's psychological torture palpable. Instead of snarking the cartoon villains, you are hunting down visions of your probably dead girlfriend while trying to make sense of the alien takeover of the vessel. A tradeoff in achieving the level of tension is that you don't feel as powerful from a gameplay standpoint. The melee and the guns were not nearly as fun or snappy as RE4, but it does give you pretty good chances to stay alive. The puzzles are more compact with less of an emphasis on item collection, and there's an added element of zero-gravity platforming. It's a bit on the short side, but appropriately so for a scary game, and certainly a gripping experience.

## Dead Space 2

Dead Space 2 largely does a lot of the same as its predecessor, but it's a welcome iteration that's hard to really find a complaint with  in comparison to the first game. The core gameplay isn't changed much, but there are new weapons and enemies. A lot of things are streamlined, like finding objectives. The zero gravity controls are one huge improvement over the original, but even in this case, it's still used pretty sparingly, as this is primarily a shooting game.

The gunplay is generally more fun than the first in my opinion, although it faces stretches where it can get a little action-heavy, particularly as the game goes on. Also, even though the bosses in DS1 weren't amazing, it was odd how they seem to opt for a lack of traditional boss fights at all, aside pretty much from the end. So maybe it's not a complete improvement over the original, but in certain areas it's at worst a bit of a wash. Likewise, it was a welcome sight to see more environmental variety, although the setting and story of the first game were arguably a little bit tighter. I was worried about Isaac speaking in this one but in hindsight it was silly to be concerned. This is an _early_ 2010s game - not late 2010s, which is when (often inappropriately) quippy protagonists became common. I think the psychological horror setting fits for a silent protagonist conceptually about as well as any could, but giving Isaac dialogue was a net positive for me in the end, even if a small one. 

## Donkey Kong (1994)

I heard good things about Donkey Kong 94, but this was a bit of a letdown. Nonetheless, I did go through the whole thing. It is arcade style, sometimes to a fault, as the precision of certain jumps that you don't have great control over can be annoying. There are differing degrees of fall damage in the game, which can lead to some trial and error unless you have a really good eye for it, as I'd often find Mario rolling out of a medium fall into an obstacle. Perhaps these sources of difficulty are necessary evils given the limited screen space, and at least it's very generous with extra lives. Where DK94 really sings is the more puzzle-y elements that are introduced, where it deviates more from the original arcade games and feels more fair. Overall it's a pretty impressive package in the limited constraints, but it also had me yearning for games that were able to break away from those constraints and lean more into the puzzle aspect.

## Donkey Kong Country

Donkey Kong Country was a staple of visits to my friend’s house. A perfect game for two-player mode, its big advantage over Super Mario World was that you had the option to switch off between players mid-level rather than between levels. Of course, more than this, we were all fixated on the graphics, which were sort of a teaser for the 3D games that were on the horizon. Perhaps so fixated we didn’t notice that it was otherwise a pretty standard 2D platformer—maybe even a little bit below standard, when compared to games like Mario and Sonic. Nonetheless, while it might be overly simple in terms of level design, it’s inoffensive; frustration is rare outside of a few difficulty spikes and some wonky collision detection. It’s not as fun to thoroughly explore as later games, but I do still enjoy giving it a quick run-through every once in a while. The graphics and music still hold up as a highlight; the jungle and snow levels in particular are some of my favorite visuals of the SNES trilogy. And of course, Rare breathed a lot of new life and personality into a series that felt like a relic at the time, showcasing their trademark humor that would define a lot of Nintendo fans’ childhoods in the 90s.

## Donkey Kong Country 2

Though it usually scores high marks, I can’t help but always feel like DKC2 is a bit overlooked. Perhaps this reflects my own experience a bit: I played a ton of the first as a kid, but never even knew there was a second one until I approached adulthood. Maybe some of the issue is that it looks a lot like 1 visually, but can you blame Rare? Everyone loved the pre-rendered graphics! And the similar visuals and engine no doubt helped them to get this out just a year later, but in spite of all that, it is a different game entirely.

About the only questionable decision here was to toss out Donkey Kong, but Dixie Kong is fun to play as in her own right. Everything else was a big improvement. The level design is totally overhauled, with you moving in directions other than to the right, and all the new game mechanics that come with added verticality. Instead of feeling tacked on, animal buddies are essential to some levels, and helpful in finding secrets in others. The secrets are much better as well—better telegraphed (albeit some can still be pretty obtuse), better designed, and with purpose! They added an entire bonus world that you can only complete by finding all the secrets, which even culminates in a special boss fight and true ending. Speaking of which… yeah, the bosses are better too, being more level-appropriate as well as requiring much more dynamic approaches to defeat. Overall the game just plays better too, with little things like collision detection improved. Lastly, they somehow upped the ante with the soundtrack even more. If you enjoy the first DKC, it’s mandatory to play this one.

## Donkey Kong Country Returns

I remember when this was announced, Donkey Kong had somewhat disappeared from the zeitgeist outside of his party game appearances, but I was among the fans excited for the revival of a 14 year old series. They were even doing it with Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, just the way it all started. It turned out not to be the game I was really expecting, but I'm not sure why that bothered me at the time. 

DKCR feels a lot more streamlined in terms of secrets and collectibles, but it is by no means a trivial game to get everything in. A lot has changed in 2D platformers since the 80s and 90s. That era might have been the peak for me, but modern ones have added a lot to take advantage of the new technology, with DKCR being no exception. There's a greater emphasis on spectacle, with wide-panning camera shots, shifts between foreground and background, and silhoutte levels. In a series that was initially famous for its graphical intrigue, visuals once again rule the day, but a challenging, tightly-designed platformer lies beneath.

## Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze

There's not a whole lot to say about Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze that wasn't already said in my Donkey Kong Country Returns review. On the surface, there isn't much that's different aside from being in HD, plus the addition of some familiar faces back into the mix. But DKCTF is certainly not just a retread of DKCR, as it expands upon those concepts bit by bit. It's hard to explain, but it's like the approach was to make each level about 15% bigger and more creative than they did before. It feels similar, yet adds up over time. Every level has its own thing going on, and they together tell a little story for the world, which is really what makes the game worth visiting in such a crowded genre. The size and scope can sometimes be overwhelming, but it makes both of Retro's DKC games worth playing depending on how intense of an experience you're looking for.

## Donkey Kong 64

DK64 is a game I never owned but had some faint memories of playing in childhood. By the time I gave it a proper playthrough, I had long since heard about its infamous collectible count, which made me sort of dread it and put it off for a long time. The collectibles, which are color coded by Kong (who can only be switched out at fixed locations), _are_ pretty annoying, but it's a game that is much more broadly tedious. What I didn't expect was how many different switches and abilities would also be limited to a specific Kong. It would be one thing if the abilities were interesting, but it's a lot of doing the same thing with each arbitrarily restricted Kong. For example, you can ground pound a switch, play an instrument on a pad, or shoot a switch - all of which are functionally the same thing (except the surprisingly uncommon shooting switch that isn't at ground level). To make matters worse, you have to seek out Cranky, Candy and Funky in different parts of the level to learn these abilities, sometimes with each of the five playable Kongs. The Kongs do have some unique abilities from each other, but they're mostly activated at prescribed locations, so they don't have much broader use outside of doing the adjacent objective. Otherwise they have the same basic move sets with some of the expected minor differences in jump height, attack power, etc.

The general movement feels somehow like a downgrade from Banjo-Kazooie. I think they were trying to simplify things a bit, as there isn't as much using combinations of buttons for attacks, but it also makes the attacks feel less controlled. You get projectile shooters, but with the N64's single stick limitation, there isn't a great way to use them outside of required objectives since you can't properly aim while moving. I was surprised how thin it is on platforming, being far more minigame heavy than the Banjo games. Some of these minigames are more involved, like the minecart levels, but there are a lot of lazy arcade/Game & Watch style quick games, including lots of repetition. Don't expect the minigames, or really a lot of the objectives at all, to have much logic relating to the Kong that initiated them.

Despite the complaints, my overall reception to DK64 is more mixed. The N64 library is so thin that at least it's one of the top games, superficially. It's poorly designed but polished if that can make any sense; you would play it and feel like it should be a good game. The absurd amount of collectibles is at times satisfying in a dopamine-y way, as you'll be constantly making the numbers go up. I'm a fan of Grant Kirkhope, and didn't dislike his soundtrack here, though it would've been neat to see DKC veteran David Wise take a crack at it. Grant's soundfont reuse makes it sound awfully like Banjo-Kazooie, while managing to be a step back with less inventive use of its famed MIDI instrument fading. The funny-awful DK Rap might be DK64's biggest contribution to gaming, and it happens before you even create your file. The settings of the levels are also a mixed bag, not being particularly memorable, but they feel like they continue the DKC vibe reasonably well. I also appreciated that DKC's famous roll jump made it in, even though the number of uses is very limited. Lastly, a couple animal buddies from DKC made it in, a fact that I was initially excited about, but they sadly were so underutilized I forgot about them in the second half of the game.

DK64 is certainly not a great game, and maybe not even a good game, but it was nice to finally cross it off my list. It was something new to play while having a bit of nostalgia value due to its closeness with the related (and better) Banjo games. I will also always defend my position that Rare games have a knack for exuding an intangible charm, which this one may not be the peak example of, but it certainly has it. Flawed that they may be, it's another one from their prime that was at least clearly made with a lot of love.

## Donkey Kong Bananza

I'm not sure how I feel about the long-awaited follow-up to Super Mario Odyssey being a Donkey Kong game instead, but at least it had been long enough since we had seen ol' DK as well that this was a welcome entry. It's also interesting to see more of a spiritual sequel, as this has Odyssey DNA all over it, but the overall approach is quite different.

I don't know if this reached the heights of its predecessor for me, but it's a great game. I think fundamentally, Mario is a little more interesting and more "platform-y", being focused around jumping whereas DKB is more focused around terrain destruction. The terrain destruction is something that worried me a bit at the start, but it didn't take long to win me over. As you'd come to expect from Nintendo's A-team, the levels are impeccably designed; they're dense and purposeful, and of course have lots of creative visuals and concepts. The various ways to smash terrain strike a good balance of instant gratification without completely trivializing a level. The greatest strength is that constant feeling of making numbers go up, like progress is never very far away.

The progression in DKB actually reminded me a bit of an older 3D Zelda game, with areas of "regional problems" to solve before you can experience the level fully or move on to the next one. I recall a bit of this in Odyssey, but I think it might be even more in DKB. This is aided by not having arbitrary banana (moon) counts to depend on for advancing; instead, they go towards skill enhancements. The game is easy enough to not need to think about these too much, but it's a more sensible approach to the collectible. The same could be said for the fossils as a superior second-tier collectible to Odyssey's purple coins. You also have the getaways and outfits that now give minor buffs. There are plenty of cool iterative improvements here, and I think comparing the two just comes down to which style of platforming you prefer. 

I find the destructible terrain fascinating to think about from a techincal perspective, but the greatest feat that DKB achieves is in unifying the "original" DK lore with the elements that were brought in mostly by Rare. As Nintendo has been reintroducing Pauline in recent years, and making her an obvious centerpiece of this game, it's evident that they had some differences in vision for DK than what it became. But most of Rare's contributions are treated with reverence, even down to the fun Bananza powers being a nice callback mostly to the animal buddies of past games. As much as I love Rare (and like Retro), let's face it: Nintendo is the far superior developer, and this is a welcome "taking back" of their iconic character that doesn't trample on what those temporary stewards of him did. I look forward to seeing what they do with the stubborn ape next, although hopefully it won't be another decade long wait.

## Duke Nukem 3D

Most people think of Doom as the foremost FPS of the pre-Goldeneye, pre-Half-Life days, and while they are probably right to think so, I always bet on Duke. Now some of this does come down to availability, as despite the fact that everything runs Doom, in the 90s that wasn’t quite the case, plus I was a kid without a lot of money. At some point I ended up with the N64 port of Duke3D, and there was no Doom N64 port (although there was of course a Doom 64, a different game), so there you have it. I was aware of Doom and admired it from afar, but even if I played it more at the time, I might have still gravitated towards Duke.

Why? Sure Doom had the blood, but Duke had blood, babes _and_ badass attitude. It was of course a perfectly alluring game for a pre-adolescent boy. Mere graphic violence was fairly common by this point, but the rest was not, and gave it an extra forbidden fruit quality, even with the watered-down N64 version. Nowadays I’d like to think I’m generally above such things, or at least they aren’t of primary concern in picking out a game, but it’s regardless just fun to play. It does have some of the pitfalls of early FPS—obtuse secrets, confusing maps and just generally high difficulty—but those are also the things that make these fun to look back on. In contrast to Doom, you also have a higher range of motion and the ability to look freely. I’m not sure if it was the first FPS to have free aiming, but it’s easy to take for granted now that it wasn’t there from the start. And of course, loaded with pop culture references and irreverent humor, I’m sure I’d still notice a few new things if I were to go back to it.

## EarthBound

There’s more than meets the eye with this quirky tale about a bunch of children going around suburban America. A game that feels delightfully out of place in the typical Nintendo fare, the Shigesato Itoi-helmed RPG does have its fair share of mature themes. You meet a cult with allusions to the KKK and delve into Ness’ psyche. The final boss is… something. It is punctuated by a lot of humor, however—sometimes gently dark humor that reflects this maturity, like Ness’ overworked father only being seen as a phone. There are plenty of pop culture references and puns throughout.

Initially I disliked the lack of battle animations, but eventually grew to appreciate them. Having your battles described in writing conveys the absurdity of fighting a piece of abstract art better than animations would. Much of the game is standard RPG fare for the time: you engage in turn-based battles where you can attack, use an item or use magic; and over the course of the game they get more complicated. You go around town to town along the way, getting better weapons, doing some peculiar sidequest for someone. Of course, as is often the case with RPGs, it’s more about the story and characters, and in this case humor. There are still some unique battle mechanics, like the rolling health meters, which can really add a lot of tension. I also appreciated the way weak enemies just get wiped out instantly, instead of wasting your time loading a battle screen. Thankfully this game, though rare in its original form, was brought to the attention of much wider audiences so I could experience it.

## Elden Ring

By the time I played Elden Ring, I still had only some of the earliest Souls games under my belt, so it was quite the leap across a decade. In many ways, after all this time it is much the same game, now in an open world, but that description certainly sells it short. It's everything that's great about Dark Souls, amplified. A great big world to explore with lots of freedom, countless boss fights and your typical mysteriously forlorn characters. There are of course key areas for advancing the story, but ER promises you the ability to explore more at your own pace and veer off as a way to grind a bit while seeing something new. 

By no means does the more open world mean ER is a dumbed down take on Souls games, and I even found myself sometimes taking breaks rather than continuing to hone up at another side area. This is because the boss fights are so much more fleshed out than early entries, with deceiving attack patterns that will constantly keep you guessing. The sheer quantity and versatility of the bosses is what makes the game so impressive; many other games would struggle to make even one boss that's as good as ER's dozenth best or so. Again, some were frustrating walls, but I realized over time how to use some of the advantages the game gives you. Things like summons and smithing are made simpler compared to earlier games, plus you have  ashes of war, mixed physick, and even a horse that lets you zip around certain battlefields. That's what "easy mode" is in these games, as there is a whole debate around which advantages players like to use or not.

My favorite part of these games is the world and level design, and it was a lot of fun untangling my way through the big open world. They're not just visually striking and unique, but constantly challenging how you think about the space the way they are dotted with little secrets and items to entice you. This of course is not new to ER, but again, like everything else in the game, it's a grand, celebratory culmination of 13 years perfecting this design.

## Final Fantasy VI (III)

Growing up, I was never really a big RPG fan—I wasn’t against them per se, but it wasn’t a genre that landed on my radar (probably due to not owning the big RPG consoles of the time, the SNES and PS1). One of many games on this list first introduced to me via the SNES Classic—and my first Final Fantasy—I could see why FF6 is often seen as the pinnacle of 2D FF games. Though at times some things feel dated, mainly the translation, they also add to the charm and mystique. I get an indescribable feeling playing classic JRPGs, which capture ideas and themes that are a mix of both foreign and familiar. 

The very core plot of FF6—madman tries to take over the world—is very simple, but there is far more to it than that. It’s about the characters you meet along the way, learning about the various factions and how they got to this point, and the ambitious, artful setpieces. Compared to many of the more cheery, simple-minded games I was playing from the era, it explores darker themes like war, death and nihilism. With a huge ensemble cast, there is a lot of story to take in, but the big roster gives you a lot of options. Everyone has some unique ability they can take advantage of, and over time they can also be trained up in magic. There are certainly quirks to the gameplay, but for someone like me who had mainly played RPGs like Pokemon and Paper Mario to that point, it was fun to experiment with all of it. Oh and that soundtrack. You gotta talk about the soundtrack. I had first heard Dancing Mad outside of the game and thought it must be a remix; I was floored that this was something produced by a SNES. The whole game is full of amazing tracks, quirky moments, and… well it’s just one that needs to be played to really understand.

## Final Fantasy VII

Another one I was very late to the party on, it’s nonetheless undeniable why this is an all-time classic. Much of the game itself is not so timeless, namely the pre-rendered backgrounds, weird translation and some odd gameplay moments. When I played this, comparisons to FF6 came to mind, and this is one of those cases where a late 2D game occasionally outshines an early 3D game. It can be at times difficult to parse where to go in FF7 (even with the markers), and it’s stuffed with so many mini-games and pseudo-QTEs that sometimes add to the charm but often just don’t really work. However, I enjoyed the Materia system much more than the comparable Espers from FF6, and the battle screens look decent for the time, particularly with summons.

But the most striking jump made here was in tone and maturity. Your heroes swear and commit acts of terrorism. The main character, Cloud, fights less for justice and more for his own past. Avalanche fights for justice… aggressively, with consequences, both direct and as a result of Shinra’s exploitation of public opinion. It raises questions that apply to our real world, like what is a justifiable cost for progress and industrialization? Is peaceful resistance to corporate oppression possible in a world where complacency is rampant? 

And of course there is so much more… occasionally the story gets a bit convoluted, and some goofy things happen, but it’s a big journey with so many twists and turns. Like with FF6, I have difficulty remembering it all, but I just know it’s one of those games that makes me _feel_ something as I’m playing it. It’s a stellar example of the unique storytelling potential of video games.

## Final Fantasy VII Remake

This is certainly no purist's take on remaking FF7, but definitely a must play for any fans of the original. I was impressed by how the anti-corporate and environmentalist messages weren’t sanitized and, if anything, are often even bolder. There are moments it feels a bit stretched out with sidequests and extra story details, but for the most part they managed to make a whole game of the Midgar area work. At its best, we see a more detailed depiction of the undercity class struggle; the fight between a bleak but outwardly stable corporate status quo and controversial radicalism to win over the people is very pertinent. 

At times bosses can be long, and there is still somewhat of a guessing game to equipping materia ahead of a fight, but I found the combat to generally be much more fun than the strict turn-based (often random) battles of the original. The voice acting is good most of the time, and especially at key times, and many of the action sequences in the cutscenes are incredible, even if it’s just flashy. I don’t think anyone would say this is some low-rent experience, regardless of anything else they may feel about it.

FF7R does struggle at times with some confusing meta-narrative elements. It isn't fourth wall-breaking per se, but does implicitly acknowledge itself as a remake. For the most part I don't think this matters too much, but I could see why it turned some people off. It tonally still hits a lot of the right notes, even if it owes a lot of that to the original, but it was so much fun to see the gang brought to life in a new manner.

## Final Fantasy VII Rebirth

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that I had pretty clear expectations for, in that it would probably have the things I liked about FF7 Remake but also some things that I disliked. And my expectations were pretty much correct, so a lot of my sentiment towards Rebirth can be summed up with my Remake review. But just because it had a lot of those same things in place doesn't mean there wasn't a lot added.

Early on, I almost rolled my eyes seeing yellow paint climb holds, tower-climbing, quest-filled open maps and item crafting, gameplay elements that were already outdated in the 2020 predecessor that managed to avoid them. But perhaps "outdated" is a bit unfair - they are a bit cliche in AAA, but serve their purpose. Rebirth doesn't break the mold as an open world game, and arguably isn't even _that_ open world with the way it's sectioned off, but that can also strengthen it by making the sometimes checklist-y quest items managed by region. I did enjoy exploring on Chocobo even if it's just another take on a horse, but they gave them a few special abilities that were nice. 

Just like Remake, it does lean heavily on the strength of the source material, but it does avoid the very possible trap of screwing it up. There are certain times maybe it can lack in subtlety compared to the original, plus some confusing stuff, but it makes up for it with mostly good added and expanded material. 

Rebirth isn't all that revolutionary in general, but it might be a potential all-timer just for all the things it throws at you. A lot of big budget games lately either find the one thing they're good at and stick with it, or they're open world games that repeat various shallow content all over. Rebirth obviously is closer to the latter, but it's far from the worst example of tedious open world tasks, as the story payoff can often be good worldbuilding, and a lot of it is close enough to the main path. But aside from the usual open world elements, Rebirth has a lot more, and it feels like a throwback with all the minigames honoring the original's legacy. With one exception (Queen's Blood, and _maybe_ Chocobo racing), the minigames are all fun but not great, the kind of thing you'd play just for the main game objectives but not get wrapped up in otherwise. Yet I'm not sure I'd have it any other way, as it makes them just minor distractions in the game that don't demand too much of your time when you see one, though collectively add up in the experience.

Rebirth is full of silly elements aside from the minigames, and that's the charm of it. It knows when to be serious, and the themes are ever resonant. But it's not the kind of game that is so self-serious it is afraid to have too much fun at its own expense. Sometimes Rebirth moments can be a little corny, campy or gratuitous, but only within the context of themselves; they don't spoil any of the bigger picture, and it's hard to even imagine it at all without them.

## Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2

There are few retro revivals that reach back as far as the Geometry Wars series, vaguely recalling the visuals of Asteroids. Its origin might be one of the unlikeliest gaming Easter eggs ever, a game-within-a-game that I originally found playing Project Gotham Racing 2. The lazy name and concept even reflect that it's a throw-in to something else. Fundamentally it's a space shooter where you shoot at shapes, and that's about it. Are they sentient floating shapes, or just aliens who were big fans of geometry? Who knows, but the important thing is there are many of them and they want you dead.

There's not much else you can say about a simple game, but the execution is terrific. The twin-stick controls are super smooth and intuitive. There are a few different modes, all of which are build around the concepts of evading and/or shooting ships as you go around, but with enough twists to keep it fun. I'm not a huge fan of classic arcade games, but Geometry Wars is one of those insanely addictive "one more try" games that proves the concept of going for a simple high score still holds water.

## Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions

I can't decide which of the Geometry Wars games I played is my favorite - GW2 was a nice simple arcade-esque throwback, but GW3 is more of a full-fledged game. Make no mistake, the arcade fundamentals are still there, but in this one you have a pretty sizable campaign to go through with many different levels. The big twist that allowed them to have so many variations is taking the game 3D, but not in the way one might think. It's really still a 2D twin-stick shooter, but the "plane" of the playfield is now wrapped around 3D objects, which adds an extra layer of challenge. There's not much else to it... no big story or epic moments, but a game that is just _fun_.

## Grand Theft Auto III

I’m not sure when the term “open world” came into use—it feels like a recent thing, yet I’ve seen it applied (retroactively?) to games as old as the original Zelda. Even the now-dated “sandbox” feels too recent for GTA3. Regardless, even if we didn’t know what to call it, we knew this progenitor of the modern open-world game was different. Sure, there were non-linear games with a big world, but those worlds were usually something of a hub between various towns and dungeons. In GTA, instead you were in one continuous (albeit segmented) zone; the overworld isn’t where you go between the action, it _is_ the action. While the main missions were a bit straightforward and unlock in a linear fashion, the map is dotted with all kinds of secret collectibles and side missions, down to even ad-hoc ones like the taxis and ambulances, being tied to a vehicle rather than a particular location. 

When I was a kid playing this, the most fun to me was no mission at all: pumping the game full of cheats and going on a criminal rampage, or perhaps trying some cool driving stunts, or trying to get past the barriers between islands. This was the promise of an open-world game, that it lets you take your time, do things your own way, but entice you with just enough rewards to get you to nibble away at the main content. Structurally, a lot of this was already present in the first two GTA games, which I had actually played prior to 3’s release. But the top-down nature of those already felt dated in the PS1 era, so GTA3 was also a strong endorsement of the then-next-generation, helping to fully realize this into 3D.

## Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

It’s hard to believe this sequel to GTA3 came out only a year later. Though not much different fundamentally, it brought in a brand new map, bolder casting (led by Ray Liotta), motorcycles, enterable buildings, and a far more familiar soundtrack. At the time, it wasn’t common to have this kind of celebrity casting in a video game. The portrayal of a specific period in recent past times was also something I don’t really recall much in games at the time. And while neon-soaked nostalgia is cliché these days, I recall it being a pretty early example of media taking us back to the 80s. GTA3 and VC probably wouldn't be most people's picks for the best games in the series, but they are certainly the ones I played the most. While the series would go on to improve over time, none of the subsequent entries were quite as formative of a gaming experience for me.
