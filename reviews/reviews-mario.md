This is for platformer-focused Mario games, which, as I realize now, at least do a fairly consistent job of having "Super Mario" in the title, considering how many branches of platformer he's been in. That means games like Mario Kart are not in this list, and can be found under their exact name. The one exception here is arguably a Yoshi game, but it is the one that's on the borderline, with a North American title that doesn't help the confusion.

## Super Mario Bros.

What is there really left to say on Super Mario Bros.? It already graces nearly every best games of all time list ever made. SMB was compelling for its tight physics, intuitive gameplay, catchy tunes and progression-based structure.  I'm sure it's not the first game structured around an "adventure" with a proper beginning and end, but it might be the first popular one. No doubt its popularity was aided in large part by being a pack-in game, but I think it also retained a degree of arcade sensibilities that made it familiar to players at the time. For example, levels are strictly on one plane, and the way levels sometimes repeat later with more obstacles is very arcade-like. Then there is the arcadey score system, which somehow survived the Mario design ethos decades on--not that I mind the score, but I never really cared about it; the objective to me was progressing through levels.

To say there have been many advances in the Mario series since SMB would be an understatement, but it remains a very playable, tightly-designed game. There is just something undeniably fun and simple about doing a quick run through every so often. For a short game (even without using warps), I feel like there’s always room to find a new thing to appreciate every time I play. Having used warps so many times, it is refreshing to mix it up, visit those levels I had completely forgotten about and craft my own new experience with the game, however small the variances. 

## Super Mario Bros. 2

The oddball sequel to SMB, for a long time I had a mixed opinion of this, but I’ve learned to appreciate it for what it is. Among the many strange NES sequels, perhaps this one most represents a deliberate effort not to replicate its hit predecessor: there literally was a different SMB2 that was left in Japan for having too much similarity to the original. Instead, the American version is a game that plays much more like an “adventure” platformer, eschewing the timer and simple left-to-right layouts from before, but still within an overall linear sequence of levels. 

SMB2 stands out due to its weird cast of characters and scenery, possibly owing to its origins as a re-skinned game. I remember that as a kid I used to actually be terrified of the floating mask that comes after you when you steal the key. To this day I still find a certain mystique surrounding the visual design of many of its levels. It feels like it belongs in Mario, yet there is a certain vibe that was never replicated again in any future mainline Mario games.

## Super Mario Bros. 3

SMB3 was my first _favorite_ game. This does not mean it was the first game I played that I enjoyed, but the first time I started thinking about games as favorites. Maybe that just says more about where I was at in my mental development than it does about the game, as I was probably only 5 or 6 years old,  but whatever the case, this is where things were different. Games were no longer a thing to put on and pass time and have fun and try to win. After this, even if I didn’t fully realize it at the time, this is when I first started to see games as their own distinct experiences, each having something different to offer, sometimes good or bad. 

With Mario 3, it’s really hard to say anything bad, even to this day—it’s not only the best NES game, but one of the few that still fully holds up by modern standards, and would probably land in my hypothetical overall top 10. Considering both SMB2 versions’ gameplay and history, in some ways this is the first true successor to SMB1, and immediately into the game it becomes apparent that there were some significant upgrades. First, a world map that teases you with branching paths and optional levels. Then ten seconds into the first level you get a brand new power up, which immediately teaches you not just its ability, but that these levels… scroll up! And if that doesn’t really sound like a big deal, well, it is just a minute into the game, and they really hit the ground running from there.

Flush with wilder secrets, clearly varied visual themes, bankable power-ups (including warps!), ambitious level design and of course, those suits, SMB3 raised the bar immeasurably high over its predecessors. The arcade leftovers of SMB1, the adherence to some semblance of patterned rigidity—these were obliterated for a sequel where you quickly learn anything goes. This is where the wonder for Mario truly began to take off, beginning the tradition of Mario games being somehow extremely refined yet consistently experimental. Whenever Mario does experiment, it usually lands, yet even a great idea isn’t immune to being culled from a future game in the name of constantly innovating. It’s a bit of a grim fate for all of these amazing ideas, but it is also what makes a game like SMB3 consistently worth coming back to. The greatest games should feel at home their respective series, yet also provide a wholly unique experience to keep them from going obsolete in favor of future entries.

## Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3

The title is bad, but the game is good. This is one I've played a million times in the past, including the GBA form, but mostly the NES one. I didn't actually play the main game, but there is one cool addition here: eReader levels. I was later surprised to learn that the eReader was considered pretty obscure, as even I (with a very limited gaming budget as a kid) owned one. I had a few of the level cards too, but I believe they were sold like trading cards, so it was of course impossible to get them all. 

Having them all available is awesome, and there's nothing wrong with any of the ones I played, but I didn't get around to doing them all. Nowadays, Mario Maker is a much better option for getting more 2D Mario action, although this is sort of like a distant precursor to MM, in that some levels mash together elements from different 2D Mario games.

## Super Mario World

SMW is one of those games that I have special memories of, not having owned a SNES myself as a child, so I would end up playing it a friend's house. In hindsight, it's funny how short the game is, but we would play it _constantly_, making little bits of progress every time I visited. The save feature was a huge innovation over SMB3, allowing you to pick it up and put down without having to start over or be dependent on warps. The levels are considerably longer, and full of branching paths and secret exits, and most notably, your legendary companion Yoshi makes his debut. In contrast to the more experimental ways that SMB3 would innovate, SMW feels like a game that has all the leftover ideas they couldn't achieve on NES.

As I said, the amount we played SMW as children without beating it is staggering. Or maybe we actually did beat it and I misremembered. The thing is, either way, the replay value of SMW is extremely high. The switch palaces make for some degree of choosing your own difficulty, plus with all of the secret paths, there are countless different routes you could choose for a playthrough. I remember being amazed at not one but two secret worlds, and those levels in the special world were no joke. More than any Mario game before, there were layers upon layers to unpeel from this all time classic. And even after you've seen it all, it's another one that's always good for a runthrough once in a while.

## Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island

The story with Yoshi's Island goes that its childlike art style was supposedly a cheeky response to the popularity over Donkey Kong Country's graphics. Unfortunately the Yoshi series would later take being for children a little bit too much to heart, but Yoshi’s first go at the starring role in a platformer was a mighty fine game.

The marketing of this game, particularly in the West, was a bit confusing, as it capitalizes on the Mario name, but goes in its own direction. Though still a platformer of course, and with some of the conventions you’d expect from Mario, its main distinction is being focused more around exploration than speed. The timers and thousands-high scoreboards are gone, instead presenting a sequence of levels where various collectibles are hidden throughout. Generally speaking, the objective is still to beat a series of levels, but if you collect everything for the perfect 100 score, you can unlock more bonuses and extra levels. Admittedly, since the levels are bigger and slower-paced, I don’t find as many things stick out in my mind compared to traditional Mario, even despite Yoshi’s Island having fewer levels overall. And it can be tedious to go back for 100 scores since you need to recollect everything, not just what you missed before. But the game is a lot of fun as a change of pace for your familiar faces, with some cool transformations, nice music and a difficulty level that’s not insulting. 

## Super Mario 64

Most games I played as a kid are nostalgic favorites, but SM64 took me a much longer time to appreciate. I think the game I expected was something more like what would eventually become 3D Land/World, based around traditional Mario obstacle courses rather than open levels. Now that I'm much older and have played it a lot, while it's not my favorite Mario game, it's an undeniable classic.

One thing I always enjoyed about SM64 the whole time is the whimsy of the castle that serves as the hub world. The automatically sequenced levels of the first two SMBs had long since given ways to world maps, but now we were stepping into a fully interactive space. There was something magical about the simple thought of transporting through a huge painting, but it also had all kinds of little tricks along the way - an invisible painting hinted at by a mirror, pair paintings that reflect the size of the world, a painting where the jump height sets the starting water level, and more.

The levels themselves have a degree of freedom that aged even better in light of later entries like Sunshine. In spite of the six objectives, there were usually only two or three different "states" per world, allowing you to tackle things out of order. The 100 coin and red coin stars would ground you with a little familiarity across worlds while seeing what other challenges awaited you. The absence of traditional power-ups was another one of those things that probably bothered me when I was a kid, but the special caps and the cannons made up for it. Most of all, SM64 shines for its large standard moveset that greatly expands on the simple run and jump platforming we had known to that point.

## Super Mario Galaxy

How do you take one of the most successful and acclaimed franchises to the next level? How about going to space? SMG was the most audacious Mario yet, throwing out some of the structure from 64 and Sunshine for a new take. Instead of the more open levels of before, they are now more focused on a particular objective at a time, though not as linear as 3D Land/World would be. You end up with smaller levels, but much more of them, as the game is always pushing the next concept, and they're almost always amazing. There's the round planets that have a neat gravity effect. Some pseudo-2D sections make an appearance. Transformation suits are back! From top-to-bottom, it's an incredible collection of highly polished and varied 3D platforming. 

## Super Mario Galaxy 2

Super Mario Galaxy 2 is one of the best games ever, and yet I don't have all that much to say about it. The level design approach is much like the first SMG, and in my memory, it's possible if I were to try recalling specific moments I'd mix up the two games. The biggest addition obviously is Yoshi, and there was some streamlining of the world map. Other than that, it's a lot like its predecessor. It's rare for Nintendo to create a sequel that builds on the same engine and gameplay, but it's usually not a bad idea, as it's one of just several great ones to result from this approach.

## New Super Mario Bros. Wii

After SMB3 and SMW, it was difficult to see how the 2D Mario series could innovate, and perhaps that's why we didn't see a major release for many years. The NSMB series may not have quite scratched the classic Mario itch for me, but the Wii version was a big deal, bringing 2D Mario back to consoles. NSMBW may have helped revitalize simultaneous co-op in 2D games, and it's both the game's best and worst feature. It was much better suited to co-op than older consoles since things like camera zooms are much easier, but you will still end up with difficulties pacing players together. The game also allows collisions, so bumping each other off ledges is inevitable. It's a horrible way to try to play the game _well_, but the chaos is also a big part of what made it so fun.

## New Super Luigi U

After playing Super Mario Bros. Wonder, this was my compromise on revisiting NSMBU, as I never played the Luigi levels, so it let me experience something a little new too. There are some pretty creative levels, but it takes a few worlds to get going. SMBW would hit you with unique things right off the bat, but NSLU (and I assume, by extension, NSMBU) does a lot of easing into the familiar world of Mario with lots of early levels that feel "tile designed" in their simplicity.

A gripe I have with NSLU in particular is that, although the levels are shortened to 100 seconds, most of them do feel like scaled down regular Mario levels. They aren't as expansive, but they still have you exploring and stopping to think about star coins to some degree. The time limit is more there to make you _feel_ rushed than an actual challenge to overcome. Given the short time limit I would've liked to see more levels that focus on speed and timing jumps to keep your momementum, but there were very few. Additionally, Luigi's unique mechanics are rarely, if ever, tested outside of optional objectives in a level; I would've liked to see some sections where you realize you have to make an extra high or long jump to proceed. Overall, NSLU falls in an awkward spot of feeling like a lesser version of NSMBU that is afraid to fully reach its potential by breaking free from its base game's conventions.

## Super Mario 3D World

Even when I first played 3D World when it was relatively new, I feel like there was this sense that this wasn't really the next big leap for Mario. Obviously that turned out to be true, and I sure am thankful we eventually got Super Mario Odyssey instead. In the post-Odyssey world, I had little urge to come back to this, but when I had the opportunity to get the Switch version on the cheap (mostly for Bowser's Fury) I thought why the hell not.

But this isn't intended to be a negative review. 3DW is a fitting game to represent the Wii U, this thing that has a sort of underlying brilliance with no fanfare. I don't say that in the sense that it's an unknown game (by Wii U standards), but when you (again) comapre it to the more "adventure-y" style of 3D Mario games, the game itself doesn't really make a point of popping out at you or emphasizing big moments. It's just a humble collection of levels - very good ones. Experience a few minutes of some of the most creative 3D platforming around, then repeat. There are of course the fun little Mario world map things, and the boss levels have a bit more "cinema", but that's more or less it.

The stakes don't feel super high but that's sort of the beauty of it. Sometimes you just want to get straight to the point, and 3DW is pretty much all action. While these types of game maybe lack in the "total package" aspect that separates the all-timers, I'll always have a place in my heart for them.

## Super Mario Maker

The concept of a level editor has been around for a long time, but outside of things done by independent modders, it's usually tacked on to a game and often misused or underused. Few series would be able to get away with what Super Mario Maker did, making an entire game out of a level editor, but it has such an established history that players can easily understand it. The concept is simple, and it's not the only game that tiles well, but what makes it so uniquely great is the mechanics underpinning it.

There are some things that are not so great about it, namely the way you find levels. Uploading levels can also be a pain if they're difficult, as you must clear them yourself, but it is reasonable to prevent unwinnable levels - this does become annoying if you want to make any small tweaks later on. The vast majority of levels are also just plain bad, but there's definitely a case to be made that people should be able to upload whatever they want (especially considering how many are children). It can be difficult to find great ones with the in-game tools; I recall fans ended up making their own level search site.

But when you do find a great level, you will experience some of the best 2D platforming of all time. I can hardly even name all the cool things I've seen - pong, big mechs, a "Game Boy", recreations of levels from 3D Mario games, etc. - not very literally of course, being chained to 2D Mario mechanics, but when done right they work very well and with a little imagination you can see it. Even a lot of the simpler levels are cool because of the way mechanics from different Mario games are mashed up. They had to invent a lot of ways for these things to interact, but they're so smoothly integrated that there's a sort of childlike magic to it. I don't like to think about how they programmed a Buzzy Beetle shell to spin out of a Bullet Bill launcher, but rather that they just put it in there and it did its thing - which is ultimately how you see it as a player. I made some decent creations myself, but people have stretched the different combinations of mechanics so far it's mind-blowing, while at the same time feeling perfectly in place. 

## Super Mario Maker 2

SMM2 feels like something of an expansion pack to the first game, including features that arguably should've been there all along. In any case, the new level biomes and vertical levels were much appreciated. There are also plenty of powerups and objectives I wasn't fully anticipating, and even an entire new style in 3D World which somehow translated really well to 2D. 

Still, a lot of the same mistakes were made with regard to difficulty finding levels and a deluge of poor quality creations. It was a little disappointing to no longer have the mystery mushroom, especially since the Switch still supports amiibo. Editing levels also didn't feel quite as good this time around, even with multiple control styles and the ability to use the touch screen (but sans stylus). Aside from those things (and a lack of SMM1 level import, perhaps due to said small differences), it's such a completely iterative entry that I'd consider it pretty much the definitive Mario Maker game.

Like the first game, it was also supported by a limited number of updates. It was a little disappointing to not see a full new mode (the menu appeared to have space for it), but content updates like the SMB2 mushroom are the kind of thing that really elevate it over the predecessor. The highlight for me was perhaps the least Mario related of all: the ability to transform into Link from Zelda 1, with a few creative liberties taken on his abilities. I think in the Switch era Nintendo has taken bigger swings with their games (often to fantastic results); putting Link in a Mario game feels like the kind of understated oddball move that was more common in the Wii U/3DS era, but it works out great, further highlighting the greatness of the various Mario mechanics. Even with all the surprises in SMM2, it didn't hit quite as hard as the first one did, but it's still a great way to explore both my and others' creativity.

## Super Mario Odyssey

It's funny in hindsight to think that I once considered sticking with the Wii U for Breath of the Wild, but Nintendo had another trick up their sleeve: A new 3D Mario game to tempt us with. Thankfully the Switch turned out to be a great purchase for a multitude of reasons, but those two releases alone could make the case that its launch year was also its best year. Even though Mario has never really been in a slump since its debut, Odyssey was so good it somehow felt like a much-needed return to form. Structurally it's primarily like Super Mario 64 or Sunshine, which is bound not to please everyone, but I thought that style was ripe for a modern take. And with a good mix of more isolated and linear challenges thrown in, you get tastes of what makes every style of 3D Mario great.

Of course not every level or moon is amazing, but "some levels are better than others" could be said for any game, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a game that has even half as many interesting micro-objectives as Odyssey is crammed with. The base platforming is predictably great, but the hat transformation gives an extra element of surprise and variety to each level that past games only reached more sporadically. Even among the weaker levels there are no true duds, and many levels are amazing. The highlight of the game for most will be New Donk City, which boldly introduces vocalized music to the game as well as a more realistic setting, unexpectedly (don't forget the pre-release Sonic 06 jokes) culminating in what could arguably be the best level in all of gaming.

And Odyssey just keeps adding extra cherries on top after that. It went above and beyond with extra postgame content, which is hard to elaborate on if only because the surprise is part of what makes it so great. Oh, and (for the first time ever  in a Mario game?), outfits! There's no question that Mario Odyssey is a must-own game if you have a Switch, so the question becomes is Odyssey alone a reason to get a Switch? Well, we don't need to know the answer to that, given a lot of other great releases since, but in 2017 it was enough to sell me!

## Bowser's Fury

My expectations for Bowser's Fury were some kind of proto-open-world 3D Mario, and that indeed is pretty much what it is. It's based around collecting items (this time, "cat shines") to progress like in the more popular 3D Mario games, but in a single world with different "levels" scattered around it. It is a pretty small world (the game took me five or six hours to fully complete), and BF is maybe a bit unrestrained in recycling level objectives, but the way things seamlessly unfold around you is a departure from past games. Nonetheless, I wonder if this is really a glimpse into the future or if it was both necessitated and enabled by the small map; it's hard to imagine something with the scope of Super Mario Odyssey coming together like this.

Obviously all Mario games have a baseline pretty high amount of wackiness, but entries like Odyssey and Sunshine have a degree of verisimilitude to the world that isn't present in BF. One the one hand, it is interesting and admirable that BF lifts almost all of its mechanics from 3D World to produce a companion game that simultaneously feels like its own thing. On the other hand, some of those mechanics are more at home in fixed camera (or 2D) Mario games, as in this setting it further highlights a sense of obstacle courses assembled out of fun gizmos rather than a real space. Arguably this doesn't or shouldn't matter, and it is true that it doesn't change that the platforming is excellent. I just think, like in my 3DW review, that it's the kind of thing that separates the upper echelon.

There are some entirely new Mario concepts here, mostly surrounding the fury system. I do like the change in level state that this brings about, though sometimes it is intrusive and inconvenient; maybe something like a day-night system could be an interesting take in a future entry. The biggest trick BF pulls out of its sleeve is the kaiju Bowser battles, and I did have fun with these, but it leans on them so early and often that by the end it's a little anticlimactic. Of course, there are the charming little flourishes, like how nearly _everything_ is a cat. We've been starved for a new 3D Mario for a while now, and while BF is a nice little appetizer, it doesn't rise above the relatively low expectations of something that was tacked on to a remaster.

## Super Mario Bros. Wonder

When Super Mario Bros. Wonder was first revealed, I thought "Oh this is just New Super Mario Bros. with a new name." The 2D Mario series had a lot of competent but forgettable entries for over a decade while the shift to 3D was clearly a priority. It made sense to be skeptical, but eventually the hype for SMBW was too much to ignore. While 2D Mario might not ever be able to top its own classics, or get the same sheen as a 3D outing, SMBW was its best 2D entry (excluding Mario Makers) since the SNES days.

SMBW is immediately different from the NSMB series, and makes it even more perplexing in hindsight. NSMB was often overly restrained in its design for such an established series. They start with several basic grassland levels and simple Goombas and Koopas, as if they still had the tile limitations of old and didn't trust players to be familiar with Mario. Perhaps taking some cues from Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, SMBW plays more loosely with the Mario tropes to make each level more distinct. SMBW is constantly introducing different concepts and enemies to build a level around rather than maximizing the scenarios to place familiar foes and obstacles in (but many iconic enemies do make an appearance).

The power-up set in SMBW has a lot of new abilities in it, and surprisingly none that have to do with flying or gliding, functions that appear to have been integrated in some way into the badges instead. Although the badges weren't a favorite addition for a more experienced player like me, it was nice that they provided some special challenge levels for them. One of the main attractions of course was the Wonder Flowers and just the general _goofiness_ that makes the game stand out. Arguably a lot of the Wonder Flowers are just cheap visual tricks, and maybe SMBW isn't the most "platformy" Mario has gotten, but in such a well-worn series it was a welcome approach to have the surprises that break the rules a bit (a particular example being when the Wonder Flower turns movement into top-down style).

For me, the surprising standout in SMBW is the Dark Souls-style online play, which I thought would be a lame, tacked-on feature. It does make the game significantly easier, but I think it was already easy enough that its benefits are a good tradeoff. Not only is it cool in general to see others playing at the same time as you, but it gave me a little rush of excitement to leave hints to secrets for someone or save them from death (or have them do the same for me). I do hope the game maintains enough of a player base for late-comers to be able to enjoy this. I also hope for some kind of challenge mode update, but it was still a blast to play, even if on the easy side.
