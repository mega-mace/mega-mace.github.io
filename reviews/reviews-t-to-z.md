## Tetris

What is there really left to say about Tetris? It has endured four decades and counting due to its simple yet nuanced gameplay, which has been gradually expanded upon over the years without stripping the game of its core appeal. Add in the fact that it works with nearly any kind of visuals and music and that’s a recipe for an endlessly-re-releasable hit. So many other puzzle games that involve colorful falling objects on a grid have come along since, and while they are fun in their own right, nothing I’ve played has reached the heights of Tetris.

## TimeSplitters 2

I believe the first time I played TimeSplitters 2, it must have been at my friend’s house, because I have no idea otherwise how else this game would’ve entered my radar. He was a bit more unscrupulous of a gamer, or perhaps in cases like this it proved I was sometimes too fickle and narrow-minded of one. Even though we had no idea there was even a TimeSplitters 1, TS2 proved to be a worthwhile investment. As big Perfect Dark fans, we were surprised to find a lot of similarities here, with it going as far to include some multiplayer maps from PD disguised under a new name and visuals. There’s a big reason for that. I didn’t fully grasp the concept at the time, but this might be the first instance of me finding out that video game companies are not an amorphous entity, and are instead made up of individuals that sometimes move on to form new companies with their past colleagues.

TS2 was not quite as ambitious as PD in many regards, such as the weapon selection, and the campaign and cast of characters were not as memorable, but it brought over a lot of what made it great: weird guns, secondary fire modes and an expansive range of multiplayer options that include numerous characters, maps and bots. One big addition over PD is the map editor, and even though I didn’t understand what makes a good FPS map, that didn’t stop me from making plenty of bad ones!

## Titanfall 2

Titanfall 2 isn't the most popular game around, but one that I've only ever heard really good things, and I can see why. I don't know if I'm quite ready to call it one of the best FPS campaigns of all time, but the question did go through my mind as I was playing it. Granted, FPS campaigns are not one of my strongest suits anyway, but regardless, TF2 was a remarkably fun game to play. 

Obviously a key part of it is the mechanics, and undoubetdly zipping around on walls and doing double jumps is a ton of fun, especially for a genre that can be awkward for platforming. Getting into the mech is also of course a highlight, but at its core TF2 also has some snappy and satisfying control for the ordinary shooting sections. TF2's story feels almost more like a little vignette, but what it excels at is being interesting without getting in the game's way. 

In general, TF2 isn't bogged down with much. I was impressed to play something that is so "all killer, no filler", but it does it in a breezy five or six hours. At such a small amount of time, it definitely started fading from my mind pretty fast. It impresses, and does so without waste, but not for long. But it may be a game worth revisiting later at a higher difficulty level.

## Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3

It was difficult for me to choose which Tony Hawk game of the first three to select for my top 100. Laying them all out during the process was also another sad reminder of how much more often we got game sequel releases. In the case of THPS, it’s not as surprising, given they were all pretty similar. Luckily, the first game laid a great foundation for its addicting and deceptively simple gameplay of chaining ridiculous skate trick combos and completing bizarre tasks. Any of the first three rank about equally to me, but I put 3 down since most of the iterative additions were good. By the time the well-received number 4 came around I wasn't playing the series as much, and it would fall out of favor with the broader gaming population not too long after.

Nonetheless, I had a lot of fun with the series for a time, and eventually it righted the ship with the solid _second_ combined remaster of 1 + 2. And even as an outsider to the skating subculture, there was something cool about seeing how it impacted Tony Hawk, skateboarding and the extreme sports video game genre. Maybe it’s _because_ those things don’t interest me that I admire THPS so much: it belongs in the category of games that show any subject matter or genre can make for a great game when put in the right hands.

## Tunic

<details>
    <summary>Click to reveal spoiler entry</summary>
    
Tunic is a game that could easily have been a mediocre Zelda clone with some Dark Souls elements. It adheres only very loosely to the Zelda formula of having dungeons packed with items that are used to solve puzzles and open new areas of the world, which was a bit disappointing. But what sets it apart, and got me so engrossed initially, is how it revolves around collecting pieces of the in-game manual to gradually understand how to progress. This manual is, to be clear, not a sleek modern UI with tutorialized descriptions, but a virtual instruction book stylized like an NES manual. The manual is a pretty novel concept, but more broadly, Tunic is interesting for something that isn't necessarily difficult to do but modern games are too afraid of: it demands you to figure things out on your own. I didn't always enjoy this, but I think I'd rather have a game be a little too confusing than too permissive, especially a lower-budget one that doesn't rely on spectacle (though for what it's worth, I enjoyed a lot of the isometric visuals).

At least, that is how I felt for the first half of the game, when I was loving it. Then in the second half, it makes an unexpected pivot into a much worse game. The atmosphere becomes more dreary, a lot of the enemies disappear and those that remain are a big difficulty spike; but most of all, it becomes way too puzzle-y. But it isn't puzzle-y in the fun Zelda way, nor like its own first half where you have more unexplored areas to find your way to. Instead it's like the second half of Fez, with varying degrees of esoteric environmental riddles. Many of them aren't necessarily _difficult_ to solve, but overly complicated in ways that don't particularly take advantage of the medium of video games vs., say, having them in a puzzle book. At least you can beat the game without them, but you get an anti-climactic bad ending - but for me, that still beat the tedium of working through riddles to get the good ending.

## Turok: Dinosaur Hunter

I bought this port on a sale on Switch years ago for reasons I'll never know. The main thing I remember was my mom rented this for me on N64 one time when I was home sick from school, and school sick days playing video games were always awesome. So I finally gave this one a proper shot this and aside from the big world being confusing, it just wasn't all that fun to play. After quickly abandoning this it was a good reminder that chasing nostaliga works better when it's something you already know you liked.

## Uncharted 1-3

Video games are a realm that is filled with wildly unrealistic fantasy, but they are often set in worlds of magic or future tech that easily sets your suspension of disbelief. Video games are also full of violence and killing. Enter Nathan Drake, the hero of this more grounded, action movie-styled game series, where his death-defying climbing stunts and high body counts bother me much more than they probably should. Imagine if Indiana Jones had no apparent proclivity for scholarship, and killed hundreds to thousands of rival thieves who surely aren't as evil as Nazis, and that's pretty what Uncharted is about.

Of course, as crazy as it all is, it is hard to deny that Uncharted does an incredible job with its ambitious action set pieces. Another strength is the dialogue and character interactions, which do elevate the potential of a medium that was historically clunky in that regard, but still has a long way to go to match cinema. It's far more revolutionary for its cinematic approach, perhaps at the expense of well-done but pedestrian gameplay.

It's not the worst offender of this itself, but I unfortunately think Uncharted (or maybe it was Assassin's Creed) is largely responsible for the proliferation of "hold forward" climbing in modern games. Most of the gameplay excitement instead comes from the shootouts, but even they are super streamlined, with a cover based mechanic that makes heavy use of aim assist, and a lack of weapon management since you are frequently made to start over and recollect guns. I had a solid amount of fun with these, but still overall prefer shooters based more around constant movement.

I grouped all these together because, honestly, they are pretty much the same game. The first one is definitely the weakest, as the layouts of the shooting sequences are more haphazard, and enemies have a tendency to blend into the background too much. Number 2 considerably improves on this, but the improvements only got even smaller from there. A lot of the basic story tropes and outline even repeat across games. I was almost convinced 3 was the best, but by the end some of the action sequences started to feel like retreads of things done in 2. In 3 they also try to give some more backstory, but I felt it stopped short of convincingly explaining what drives Drake's psychotic adventuring. 

## Uncharted 4

You can probably tell I'm a bit skeptical of Naughty Dog's linear cinematic action games, but seeing Nathan Drake and co. go next gen (which is now last-gen) sounded promising... and it was. A lot of the core Uncharted formula is still here, but it's revamped to a point that it eclipses 1-3 nearly across the board.

To start with maybe the one area that _wasn't_ an improvement, I felt like the guns were oddly weak in this game. For 1-3 that would be a death knell, but the amount of shootouts is toned down considerably, and the seemingly nerfed weapons were likely made to encourage using the much-improved stealth. The lack of shooting sequences also works because the pacing is so much better. 

It's still a very linear game, but you get a lot more open areas that move away from that on-rails feeling of hopping from climb to climb. Though on that note, after four games, ND really honed in on how to make the climbs just subtle yet obvious enough. Of course, the addition of the grappling hook and slopes brings a nice dimension, even if most of the climbing is still for show. I wouldn't forget to mention the addition of vehicles, which are a big boon for both the pacing and the larger environments. And for what it's worth, while the story was already a strength, they even managed to outdo themselves there, with the introduction of Nate's brother and a more memorable villain than the often arbitrary bad guys of past games. And just when they finally sold me on the series, they made the bold decision to put an end to Nathan Drake's story - but you gotta admire how rare it is in the industry to quit while you're ahead.

## Wario Land 3

A few years ago, I'm pretty sure I played the first two Wario Land games, but have close to zero recollection of them. That might be a good thing, because my general expectations for a Game Boy game are to be breezy and innocuous. Unfortunately, WL3 is not very breezy and full of tedium. To its credit, it's hard to think of another 2D platformer that plays quite like it, and the idea of making Wario take abuse to progress is funny. Instead of having a timer or lives to deal with, you go around exploring levels for keys and treasure chests that serve as a level goal, with four pairs of them appearing in each level. Over time you have to revisit levels with new abilities to unlock the later chests.

It sounds like a good idea in principle, but I was quickly starting to see that keeping of track of which levels you can revisit would be difficult. There's a lot of replaying the same sections as a result of having to go back, but also because levels are littered with enemies and traps that send you backwards on each obstacle. Some of the platforming concepts are pretty novel, but it's just not fun enough to outweigh the more annoying aspects. The visual design and music also sadly fail to elevate the experience enough to be worth pushing through (although that's a pretty common case with the heavily limited Game Boy).

## WarioWare Inc: Mega Microgame$

I have a weird nostalgia for this game, as I'd play it at the kiosks in Walmart and Target back in the day, though never owning it myself. When I actually played it in 2023, it was a reminder of how different portable gaming used to be, and how lucky we are now. Although the GBA era did see an increase in full-fledged gaming experiences that could rival consoles, WW is a relic of the time when portable games were designed for 5-minute sessions. Playing through it more like a console game, it was easy to see how short and simple it really is. A lot of the microgames also feel a bit trial and error. But nonetheless, there is an undeniable charm here.

## Wii Sports

As far as legendary games go, Wii Sports was a pretty shallow experience, and a legacy that never really carried through even with there being a surprising Switch sequel. But it was a game that everyone had, coming packed with the hugely popular Wii. I can’t recall if the late model (sadly sans GameCube) from when I eventually got my own Wii included it, but I played it at so many other people’s houses and dorm rooms anyway. 

Even when this was still a thing people played, it was about half of a great game, with baseball and bowling dominating in popularity. I swear the baseball results were so arbitrary that it had to be mostly RNG, yet it was addictive with the way I would constantly convince myself, no _this_ time I’ll figure out the magic swing to hit a homer every time. 

## The Witcher 3

There is a certain modern game design maximalism trend, which I’ve come to despise, that is perhaps best exemplified by the open world genre. It’s hard for me to avoid comparing any open world games to Zelda, as it now has two outstanding modern iterations.  Both Zelda and TW3 are games where you pick up insane amounts of stuff off the ground, but in Zelda you’re incentivized to use it. You throw ingredients into a cooking pot, or fuse something to a weapon to make it stronger. It’s intuitive and imprecise (in a good way). So many games get caught up in the idea of squeezing _effort_ out of their mechanics rather than _fun_. If you want to craft a weapon or a potion in TW3, first you need to learn the recipe for it, then have the exact set of ingredients, which are extremely difficult to keep track of. Then it often turns out to do something like give you a 2% chance to freeze buff, which no person in their right mind would think is an actual fun thing in a game, but AAA marketing has told us these varieties of uber-precise min-maxing opportunities are “deep” gameplay. Beyond that, there is a lot of your standard open world/RPG stuff: adequate but not really exciting horse-riding and combat, bandit camps and loot caches dotted all over the map, and the inane Witcher sense that could only be very loosely considered a "puzzle".

Obviously, it’s not lost on me that TW3 does offer a lot that similar games don’t in the story department. But my biggest praise and my biggest criticism of the game might be one and the same: the most enjoyment I got out of it was sitting through dialogues. After coming to that realization, I thought couldn’t they have just made this a TV show? Perhaps a book series? Joking aside… that really is how I feel about it. Of course I understand that a game lends itself to choices that affect he narrative, but to me the best choices in a game should be driven by how they affect the gameplay, and that just gets back to how the gameplay offered me nothing exciting.  Ultimately I think I put around a dozen hours into this, not a lot by open world game standards, but enough that I feel like I got the general idea of what I’d be in for from a gameplay perspective. Even having tentatively given up on it, I still go back in forth in my mind as to whether that’s the right decision, but that may just be owed to my stubborn nature. On the other hand, it is a widely acclaimed game, and that tends to merit a longer leash. At least putting my thoughts into writing helps me find a little bit of closure. Am I wrong on this one, or the critics? Or has time just passed it by, and I experienced it too late?
