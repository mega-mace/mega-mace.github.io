                <p>These are all reviews I've written for commercial game releases. The organization may seem peculiar, but it's my compromise on not having too many pages nor having the pages be too long. Basically, I tried to have 20 reviews per page, give or take a few of course, so that letters wouldn't have to cross multiple pages.</p>
                <p>The reviews within a page are overall alphabetical, except when multiple entries from the same series come up. In those cases I felt it made more sense to order them chronologically, but that's a bit fuzzy too as there are spinoffs, releases in parallel on handheld vs. console, etc. When I doubt I choose the flow of reviews over exact chronology.</p>
                <p>NOTE: Reviews require rewrites, as they were originally written in the contexts of top 100 lists and year in review. I'm trying to make the reviews a little more standalone and minimize references to other reviews. This is an active work in progress and this paragraph will go away once I've updated them all.</p>
