## Animal Crossing New Horizons

Animal Crossing New Horizons might be the hardest game on this list to discuss without delving into a big cliché, that being how it “arrived at the right time”, releasing right around the beginning of COVID lockdowns and all the uncertainty that ensued. But it was a great game to play for the time, because meeting up on a virtual island (if you can stomach Nintendo’s bad online) is much better than a Zoom meeting.

Never have I played a game for so many hours while accomplishing so little, but that’s exactly the point of life sims. It’s escapism at its truest core. Most of us long not to be able to wield magic or save the world from apocalypse, but live in an idyllic setting with little to no responsibilities other than an interest free loan paid off by fishing and smacking rocks. Not to mention everyone you live around wants to be your friend, to the point they’ll even regularly send letters despite living a two minute walk away.

Beyond that, ACNH gets at our desire to express our creativity, with a bunch of decorations and island/home design options. At first, I was annoyed at the lack of a tile editor or better inventory management, but slowly grew to understand the gamification of these elements. It is time consuming, but that’s part of the escape. Plus for as many hours as I put into this, it was so easy to bite them off in little chunks: a little bit before work, a little at lunch time, a little before going to bed. Though obviously not new to ACNH, the real-time clock added to the feeling of having your own parallel world to regularly attend to. Being that this was my first and only AC game, I can’t say if it is the best one, but I’m not torn up over being introduced to the series when I was.

## Astro Bot

Team Asobi must have been just as tired of the rest of us are waiting for a true new 3D Mario game, so they did it themselves. Okay, that might not be the story, but they have created something truly Nintendo-esque in both inspiration and execution, even though it's literally about Playstation. Astro Bot rivals even the best of Mario as a 3D platformer, and it also doubles as a worthy competitor to Smash as the best celebrations of gaming. It could get by on the stellar platforming alone, but the real cherry on top is the crash site that fills out with rescued bots, many from famous Playstation games. The unlockable special bot interactions are the most fun I've had with an in-game trinket since the trophies in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Just like those, these aren't half-baked either; even though I didn't recongize a lot of the characters, I couldn't wait to see the detail put into every interaction.

Platforming-wise, Astro Bot sticks with the typical modern structure, and there are certainly elements in here I've seen before, but it has plenty of fresh ideas to bring as well. Some of the special abilities are as creative as anything out of Super Mario Odyssey, and often with a heavier gameplay significance too. The level design places a lot of importance on visuals as well, demonstrating that familiar types of challenges can be more compelling with a creative motif to the platform design. In a lot of ways Astro Bot is more about the pleasantness of interactions than hardcore platforming. The little flourishes created by the Dualsense controller would not have been crucial, but they do give some satisfying feeling. The way that actions like throwing objects don't require precise aiming show a welcome desire to give you a little freedom to take in the scenery. Nonetheless, I did find the proper platforming challenges would come eventually, on top of everything else that was great anyway. The bosses are not throwaway jump on their head a couple times pushovers either. In total, there were not a ton of Astro Bot levels that stumped me for a long time, but there is something still highly satisfying about its challenge level. It maintains a constant sense of momentum while also not insultingly walking you through the game. Astro Bot is a true marvel in a well-worn and personally beloved genre, certainly worthy of its TGA Game of the Year status.

## Axiom Verge 2

In the vast sea of indie Metroidvanias, Axiom Verge lies somewhere in the middle. While your Oris and Hollow Knights are more ambitious projects that feel like a distant relative of Metroid, developer Thomas Happ took the Shovel Knight approach of cramming it with mechanics lifted from well-known classics of yore. Its design inspirations are quite obvious to veterans of the genre, and for better or worse it will feel right at home. It's well-designed, but safe and lacking in innovation. _Unlike_ Shovel Knight, Axiom Verge is severely hampered by a lack of a strong identity: the characters are nondescript, the music is atmospheric but not particularly catchy, and the dialogue and visuals are overcomplicated instead of punchy.

To be clear, this is all describing the first game, but none of these flaws were really fixed in #2. I think I enjoyed it a little more than 1, but that could just be since it's fresher in my memory. The levels feel a little more open, the story more ambitious and the abilities more customizable, but it's overall a lot of the same. One big change is a focus on melee combat, which I think was a good move in theory, but rarely ever feels that great in this - luckily you can skip most of it. The other most significant difference is the greater emphasis on a dual-world concept, which is a highlight that recalls games like A Link to the Past. There are a few moments where I found myself confused with backtracking, but I thought overall it was pretty sensible with the world design and progression. I did get pretty into playing it, as this kind of game is good gaming "comfort food", even if I didn't come out all that impressed. Like the first one, it seems destined for me to largely forget it within a few years, but not bad for a recent indie that was made free on PlayStation Plus.

## Banjo-Kazooie

Banjo-Kazooie is another game that came to my attention through a gaming magazine. Having a bear that carries a bird around in a backpack is just one of those mad genius ideas so brilliant that I had felt like I already knew these now-beloved and iconic characters before I picked up the game. I was nearly eight years old when the game came out, but it feels weird to remember there was a part of my life that didn’t have Banjo and Kazooie in it. This might be Rare at the height of their powers, in terms of creating a world that hits the exact right amount of challenge, characters, charm and humor. BK feels like one of those games that was made specifically _for me_, yet clearly I’m not its only fan.

I wasn’t sold on the 3D platform genre yet, as evidenced by my Mario 64 review, but this one is what I dreamed that Mario could be, even though now I see the two games as being pretty distinct from one another. Banjo doesn’t have as many worlds overall, but they are more strikingly themed, filled out with funny characters and big concepts. One world, as everyone who’s played it would obviously remember, is based around the four seasons. And who could forget that quiz show ending? Grunty’s Lair was ominously fun, a growing tower of terror. The transformations were a great touch. It’s just really hard for me to say anything bad about BK. While it’s less ambitious than other Rare collectathons, that means it’s much more restrained as well. And let’s face it, not every objective in a collection platformer is always a winner, even in the best of them—but by keeping it simple with their first go at it, Rare ensured that the great moments always outshine the dull ones.

## Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge

Who knows why I played this game nearly to completion in the 2020s, other than it's more Banjo and Kazooie, and we don't see a whole lot of them. I knew of this game's existence back in the day but it still felt like playing some long-lost item. Overall there's not much good to say about it, but it isn't terrible either. The isometric perspective probably felt more novel at the time but ironically I think a sidescroller would've made it more interesting to look back on. It has lots of depth perception issues and fairly uninspired platforming. Enemies seem to kill you easier than they should (and respawn like crazy), but at least there aren't a whole lot of consequences for dying. The plot/setting are nonsensical, as you follow Grunty back in time, but instead of the typical time travel cliches it seems to be mostly set in near-present-day with a lot of locations that recycle themes from the N64 games.

## Batman: Arkham Asylum

I'm not sure what compelled me to play this in 2023, other than it was a part of my long Xbox 360 backlog, and some amount of guilt over owning too many unplayed games sets in. I'm  not a big Batman or superhero fan, but I understood it to be a good game, and sometimes that's enough for me.

AA wasn't the most interesting game in this day and age, but it's far less dated than many of its contemporaries. Aiding in its relevance is the Metroid-like structure, still a largely unexplored genre in 3D. Coming from a weak release year, I even contemplated a place for it in the Top 100, but as I write this now and already struggle to remember much to say, it feels right to have left it off. It does a nice job of mining a lot from the Batman canon if that's your thing. The stealth based no-kill combat was also a change of pace, though led to its fair share of frustrating moments. I'm reminded a bit too much of the late 2000s gritty gaming zeitgeist, though at least in Batman the grittiness makes sense. Overall, a pretty fun game that wasn't the worst thing from that era I could've gone back to.

## BioShock 2

Like the Arkham series, BioShock is another one of the canonized Important Games of the late aughts/early 2010s, and also one that was a bit of a disappointment. Sometimes, I wonder if I just don't get it, or games have become dated at an increasingly rapid pace. The BioShock games in particular are weird ones to visit for the first time in the 2020s. They aren't _bad_ games, but it's easy to pick on them after hearing some of the haughty praise that came out around their time. Am I dumb and missing the point, or are they really not that deep? Were they the product of an industry that was desperate to legitimize itself as art, and needed something to latch onto?

At their core, I think the first two BioShocks are about it what it means to lose one's humanity. This is played out literally in the way characters are mutated by plasmids and ADAM, but mostly figuratively through the lens of two competing ideologies at the extremes of trying to dictate human behavior. It's surely a bigger concept than a lot of games, but I left both feeling like they didn't have much to say. The message I gleaned between the two was "individuality is important but constant competition will also lead to ruin", and it didn't exactly lead to any deep re-examinations of humanity.

The gameplay is somewhere between an FPS and an RPG, with a limited upgrade tree and special abilities. I like the abilities in theory, but they never feel as powerful as they should. The telekinesis for example is like a heavily nerfed gravity gun from Half-Life 2. The gunplay is much weightier than a more pure FPS, but the RPG elements aren't really deep enough to provide a super customizable experience.

The great potential for gaming is with non-linear storytelling, but I think this is best done by having a collection of characters and quests you can interact with. The BioShock approach is to litter the linear world with audio logs, which is not only an extremely played out mechanic (though surely less so at the time), but also distances you from the side characters. Outside of the main story beats I found my reaction to most things was "yeah whatever".

Most of this review could apply to 1 or 2, but they are very similar games. I did like some of the iterative improvements in 2, but I'm not sure they are enough to make it a better game than 1 given the expectations for a sequel. I was very annoyed with the lack of changes to manually looting items. The guns were slightly more fun, but generally provide the same functions as before. The new hacking was nice, but it's such a small change. If I do decide to play Infinite after this, I know at least we'll be leaving the bottom of the sea, so what other new things could be in store?

## Bowser's Fury

See Super Mario page

## Bucky O'Hare

What? Bucky O’Hare? Well, it’s one of those games that’s always been there for me… not like, emotionally, but it literally was a game that I remember being around as long as I was gaming. Most likely something purchased by an unwitting parent, which is usually a recipe for disaster, but this one turned out to be good. It also overcame the odds of being a licensed game—one of few that possibly supersedes its source material, which I didn’t even know existed in comic book and TV form until years later. You could say this was—again something I wouldn’t understand until later—an early example of me finding a “hidden gem”.

So, to actually talk about the game: basically, it’s Konami taking a stab at a Mega Man game. With the game being structured around run and gun platforming, and an initial round of selectable stages followed by infiltrating the big bad’s base, it is obvious where the comparison comes from. But outside of those superficial similarities, I think most would find that its approach to individual stage design is completely different. While generally not as good as Mega Man—the graphics and music are weaker, you only get four initial stages instead of eight, and the boss/ability design aren’t as ambitious—there is a lot to enjoy here. One cool thing is that instead of gaining abilities after defeating a boss, you rescue a different crew member with their own pros and cons, and can freely switch between all of them. But most of all, without playing this, who knows if I would’ve developed an interest in Mega Man proper, which I didn’t get around to really playing until many years later.

### Additional Review

Bucky O'Hare is the game I got started learning to ROMhack with, so naturally I needed to play it. It's also a game that appears on my top 100, more as a sentimental favorite. I don't mean that like it isn't a good game, although after replaying it, I could definitely see even more flaws than before. To be fair, a lot of those flaws are in comparison to Mega Man, but I realized just how much better MM is beyond the more superificial reasons in my top 100 entry.

I'd say that fundamentally BOH is just too easy, but I have read and watched people online say it's a hard game. I can get easily over 30 extra lives in this game... so okay, maybe experience plays a factor in that, but why even let me get that many in the first place? That's the main issue with BOH's difficulty, it's overly forgiving. I think when people say that it's hard they mean it has some tough platforming screens, and a good amount of those have instant deaths. But outside of that, it's almost laughable.

The levels don't have intermittent checkpoints like MM, instead opting to let you retry on _every_ screen, even after one of its barely-punishing game overs. Enemy placement is pretty predictable and not overly cumbersome, but it's especially hindered by their general weakness. Outside of a minority of the bosses, I'd say nearly every enemy doesn't do enough damage or have enough HP. It's the kind of game where most of my deaths are in a pit or spikes, but having HP whittled down is very rare compared to MM.

Another weird thing I noticed is that levels might have a sequence of three to four screens that use the same platforming gimmick, but their difficulties are all mixed up instead of steadily progressing. It's not the worst thing, but it does come across as sloppy. 

One thing I'll give credit to BOH for over MM is that I switched between the different characters more than I tend to switch abilities in MM, but that's more because I think MM doesn't do a great job making most of them obviously appealing. Even in BOH, out of the five characters there are only two I get much use out of; one is mostly just for boss fights and the other two only have a handful of useful screens each. The character abilities are less creative than MM powers, but they are intuitive in their usefulness; switching between characters is very snappy, and there's no guesswork about enemy weaknesses or energy cost to experimenting. This is definitely the most interesting thing BOH had going for it, but I wish it was explored more.

## Castlevania Series

### Castlevania (NES)

The first Castlevania game still remains, in my eyes, one of the best I’ve played in the series. The central premise of the design is that you have a stiff, limited moveset, but the game is built around that. It’s challenging, but controls tightly. Given this, not much else is needed for an enjoyable “Classicvania”. The game is just the right length for its difficulty, which I think is where 3 faltered. Number 1 also is far less vertical, which is good when the stairs are the cheapest element of the game. The one major flaw with these games is juggling your subweapons, as it’s often better off to die in the early stage where you can get the best weapon rather than at a checkpoint. At least you can get them back at all! And the game is still a pretty fair challenge without them, but whip-only isn’t for me.

Certainly it’s important as well to mention the horror tropes and gothic architecture, which imbue a sense of style to the series. They are limited here with the NES, but it helped set the tone for how future games would look.

### Haunted Castle (Revisted)

It's easy to see why this is one of the Castlevania titles I had never heard of before. I gave the original a shot, also included with Castlevania Dominus collection, but with how hopelessly difficult it is, I gave up on the first stage. It just wasn't worth it with a remake also an option. The Revisited version is unsurprisingly very forgiving, maybe almost to a fault, but it also was nice because the game can be breezed through in one sitting. I like the graphics, which are improved but look like some lost 90s arcade game, or perhaps one of those 16-bit era consoles I'm not familiar with. Overall this is still a pretty forgettable addition to the Castlevania oeuvre, but it was a nice throw-in.

### Castlevania: The Adventure

I knew this game was pretty maligned, but it was part of the Castlevania Anniversary Collection, and figured it's short enough to check out. Many of its shortcomings are common to other games of the era, sometimes even good ones: unfair enemy placements, ridiculously tight jumps, screen flickering, stingy checkpoints, etc. However, the fact that it has _all_ of these flaws, plus some more severe ones, means it is not one of the good ones. The NES Castlevania games pushed the limit of how stiffly a game could control and be good, and CTA goes beyond the breaking point there. 

The overall control is the worst part of the game, but things like losing your whip upgrades on any hit are also annoying. Honestly I kind of see what they are going for, as a lot of the challenge hinges on keeping your whip, much in the same way it's key to preserve your subweapons in other games. But not having subweapons already constrains you a lot to begin with, and sucks out a lot of the variety. The platforming is actually decent at times, and at least deviates from the NES entries, but gets annoying with some of the tight jumps, or climbing up a rope to the next screen and having enemies thrust at you without warning. Many sections feel extremely long and sluggish. The visuals are obviously much more limited technically, but it's severely lacking in the striking imagery that makes Castlevania great.

I persevered through this only due to heavy use of save states. I did pretty well on the first couple stages, but by the end I was saving after every encounter, just ready to see the extent of what the game had to offer, then probably never touch it again.

### Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge

It's Castlevania Mega Man! Not just in the stage select screen, but the more vertical oriented gameplay, with the new ability to whip from a chain (or rope, whatever) very reminiscent of Mega Man shooting off ladders. Other than that this game is mostly a refined version of Castlevania: The Adventure. I'd say the level design, in a vacuum, is only marginally better, though it has some interesting concepts. But its across the board improvements show that CTA was hiding a decent game somewhere, and also demonstrate how getting the fundamentals right can make a world of difference in perception. Belmont's Revenge is simply much more enjoyable to play, with far better controls, fuller music, fewer cheap traps, more checkpoints, and the return of subweapons (albeit, disappointingly, only two types). Of course six stages is also better than four, though it is also a quite short game.

Unfortunately, it is also Mega Man-esque in the design of the final boss, which was far too hard for me to go on with. It was the kind of thing that wasn't even fun to try figuring out with save states. The penultimate boss was also a handful, and the first time I used save states. Up until that point, it might be the easiest Classicvania I've played, perhaps an overcorrection from CTA. Overall, a solid throw-in for the Anniversary Collection, of which I'd already played most of its main draws separately.

### Castlevania Legends

It's a sheer coincidence that I played the first two Castlevania GB games this year, as it was before Legends was announced as a Switch online addition. Actually, until that point I didn't even know this game existed at all! It's easy to see why, as it's a late 90s game that plays more like one from the late 80s.

This game is pretty easy in some ways, but also full of some of frustrations you'd hope not to see anymore, like unfair enemy placement and bad collision detection. The lack of traditional subweapons is disappointing, and instead they appear as additional collectible items that had no purpose to my knowledge. You do unlock special subweapons after beating each stage, and can permanently select between them, which is a nice idea to introduce to the series, but most of them aren't that useful in combat or take too many hearts. I found myself save stating gratuitously to hold on to my hearts. Even if the game is known to be a little easier, I just didn't feel like dealing with any repetition. It's already repetitive enough in its overlong, meandering levels, which is really the main flaw; yet ultimately it's still a short game.

The most annoying levels had a lot of vertical action, which is where I really missed weapons like the axe. You eventually get a subweapon that can damage all enemies on screen from anywhere, but at 5 hearts a pop it's much costlier than the axe. You also get this ability that supercharges you for a short period of time, which makes most of the boss fights easy if you hold on to it until then. Really this game is just all about holding on to your abilities for the opportune moments, and dying significantly alters how easy that is - not particularly different from any Classicvania, really. It might get a slightly unfair rap, but having brought very little to the table after Belmont's Revenge (and some regressions), it's better left forgotten.

### Castlevania: Bloodlines

Castlevania: Bloodlines is another minor game overall, but a big gaming bucket list item for me, finally finishing off all the (major) "Classicvania" titles. Although I enjoy them, at this point in my life I played through it on the easiest possible setting with the easiest character (Eric Lecarde) and liberal use of save states. The big gimmick with this one, I suppose, is that you have two characters that have moments where the paths split due to their unique abilities. I also did some of the John Morris path, but got a little bored of it, as the splits are not that large.

I was a little surprised to see that the SNES counterpart, Super Castlevania IV, is generally higher received, as there is plenty to like about Bloodlines. I briefly messed around in SCIV (part of the same Anniversary Collection) after playing this, and I can say in the very least that Bloodlines has a lot more visual clarity. It's possible that it's a lot shorter (instead relying on the second character playthrough to pad it out), but length is hard to gauge with save state use. I also appreciate in Bloodlines that it tends to give you subweapons more generously, and the addition of mini bosses is a nice touch. It has its fair share of cool visual tricks as well, like mirroring, a level where you circle around a tower and a level I could only describe as looking like you're refracted through different segments. The soundtrack is certainly on par with the rest of the series. I don't know if it's one of my favorites overall, but a solid addition.

### Castlevania: Symphony of the Night

This is where the “vania” in Metroidvania comes from, although I’ve always felt the “Metroid” part does the heavy lifting. Symphony of the Night didn’t bring a whole lot of new things to the table other than the RPG elements. As alluded to in my Super Metroid review, this means that instead of picking up permanent upgrades, you get various weapons and armors that give you various stat boosts. Of course stats are also boosted through standard experience grinding that’s common in RPGs. The whole thing makes exploring a bit more of a crapshoot, although there is a certain whimsy to a lot of the items. You do also get the chance to find things that are a bit more interesting, like familiars that will follow you around.

Much of the map in this game is confusing. There aren’t as many clearly telegraphed paths as in Super Metroid, and the whole second half of the game largely eschews the item-based progression, turning into one big task of filling out the map. Then there’s the confusing final objectives which involve picking up various objects to get the true ending. But I’m probably making this sound much worse than it is. Fortunately, the game is very forgiving with its difficulty, turning the notoriously hard series on its head. It still requires caution due to a dated save system, but it certainly eases the pain of what can turn into aimless wandering.

Now I’m again sounding more like a negative review, but this game is very fun. It cannot be understated how much the coolness factor elevates Castlevania. Alucard is a suitable badass, and the control is so much snappier than Classicvania, even if I do sometimes miss the whipping (but playing as Richter is a fun bonus mode!). I love seeing what kind of enemies and settings they come up with—somehow they always seem to put a fresh twist on their own clichés. There is a lot of quirky fun stuff too, like the voice acting, the shopkeeper and strange rooms like the confession booth. I’m grateful for its influence on the genre, even if said influence is often overstated.

### Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow

I'm surprised I couldn't find many picks for 2003, but if Symphony of the Night could make it on here, then Aria of Sorrow is certainly worthwhile. That isn't to say that AoS is the better game of the two, but if it's not, it's really close. This was the third attempt at a GBA Castlevania, and while I liked the first two enough, it was clear that Konami finally figured it out. Though it can't match up to SotN in terms of graphics and sound, it plays great with the limited GBA controls. The map design and progression are far more cohesive. 

Now I realize I have very little to say about it, but there are so many Metroid style games on here and you can only say so much about satisfying senses of progression, etc. It's also a great testament to the game that it's hard to think of anything negative either. Its biggest offense is, clearly, being a bit unmemorable overall. It definitely doesn't have the same coolness factor of SotN, but it's so well-executed that it's easy to take for granted.

### Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow

I'm a big fan of Metroid-like games, and Castlevania is no exception, but good god after 5 games the Castlevania team really didn't learn a thing. I have the predecessor to this one, Aria of Sorrow, in my Top 100, though that's partly due to a weak 2003. For one thing, if I recall correctly, AoS is where there started being more RNG with the soul acquisition system. That carries over to DoS as well, but I found myself more annoyed this time, particularly when some randomly dropped souls were necessary to get the true ending. There's also a lot of bouncing around the map around the beginning of the game, because it's designed with a lot of arbitrary backtracking (moreso than the best examples of the genre).

I think the Castlevania games also have a particular tendency to back load it with a lot of bosses. Aside from being boring, this causes a difficulty spike since you get less intermittent leveling between bosses. This wasn't as noticeable in Symphony of the Night since it's easier, but with AoS the game goes from good difficulty to annoyingly hard. Not constant deaths per se, but the boss fights start feeling like you're underleveled. This mostly annoyed me at the final boss, which has a trivial 1st stage you'd have to replay if you died (but thankfully I had save states) followed by a really tough 2nd stage. 

Well I just talked more about my annoyances than the actual game, but what is there to say? The meat of it is standard Castlevania fare, even down to areas they tend to reuse (i.e. a chapel, an underground lake, clock tower) between games. Stuff like the souls system and how it's set up does flow nicely as a "subweapon", even if the RNG dependency on souls is annoying. The combat otherwise is pretty similar to past entries. Overall, still really fun with some annoying moments and lacking a bit in originality at this point.

### Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin

I was already disappointed by one DS Castlevania game this year, so I set my expectations much lower for Portrait of Ruin. That was a good idea, because that made it less disappointing! Note that this does not mean it's _better_ than Dawn of Sorrow. I'm not making a call on which of the two I prefer, but given the issues I had with DoS and how they were fixed in PoR, I'd have to say PoR is a case of be careful what you wish for.

The most original aspect of PoR is the dual character system, where you can switch between Charlotte and Jonathan, or bring both out at once (but still only controlling one directly, of course). In practice, Jonathan ends up being the superior character for most of the game, and for whatever neat potential there is with the two character action, most of the benefits are negated by the difficulty of managing them both effectively in battle. Or at least it's difficult for a newcomer to this game, but I'm not sure if it offered me enough otherwise to want to replay it later on.

The convoluted backtracking that arguably went too far in DoS is gone now, as this is the simplest Castlevania map yet - and also probably the worst. The size of the castle is shrunk down and instead you warp through portraits to other lands like towns and deserts. At first this was really cool, as it gets outside of the castle surroundings, but by a third of the way through it became apparent to me how useless a lot of these locales were. They retain the Metroid-style, but for the most part the objective is to defeat the one boss of the area, so they have a lot of extra fluff in them. And then when I got to the midpoint of the game, opening up new areas that recycle the same visual themes as the first half, it really felt like a letdown.

I don't know if PoR really has more combat than other Castlevania games, but with how exploration is de-emphaszied, it feels like a lot. Nonetheless, there is still some amount of backtracking, occassionally to a seemingly minor spot on the map that holds a crucial ability. I don't know if I like or dislike that, but it is weird in the context of a game where exploration has otherwise been greatly streamlined. At least there aren't random drops required to advance like in DoS, but there is still a heavy degree of grinding and farming/RNG if you wish to do all the sidequests and be well equipped to beat the final boss.

## Celeste

Celeste is one of those acclaimed games I didn't really have on my radar, mainly due to the vague resemblance to Super Meat Boy, a game which I just could not get into. But that made Celeste a perfect Game Pass candidate, and it has a lot going on that I liked. Of course, the key to all of it is the platforming, and even though none of its core individual elements of climbing, wall jumping or mid-air dashing are particularly novel, they are brought together in a borderline revolutionary way. I mostly focused on the main path of the game, yet that alone gets an impressive amount of mileage out of these mechanics (of course, there are a lot of context-specific abilities that show up throughout the game as well).

The platforming is fun, but the earnestly personal story and the environments that showed pixelated graphics still have something to give are what kept pushing me forward. And yet, by the end of Celeste I felt a bit like it's just a collection of highly challenging platforming screens, even if the levels are more continuous than SMB. And these aren't _flaws_ with either per se, but I'm not sure it's what I'm looking for in a platforming game. I prefer longer levels with more exploration (not to say Celeste lacks in exploration), but that can often clash with high difficulty since punishing death can be alienating. So as the difficulty gets cranked up in a platformer, the breakdown of the challenges tends to get smaller, which can make them feel both insignificant and repetitive. This type of game wears out my d-pad thumb as well, though for what it's worth, Celeste does a solid job of making the main content manageable (for patient platforming vets at least) and cranking up the difficulty appropriately for the optional stuff.

## Cocoon

Another brief one, Cocoon takes you through some interesting but ultimately forgettable landscapes with ambient electronic music in the background. The central gimmick is solving puzzles with orbs, each of which is both an ability and a world itself. In theory, the idea of hopping between these worlds is neat, but the concept doesn't get explored too in depth. In striking a delicate balance towards playability, the puzzles are naturally pretty easy, as the process of elimination keeps your options narrow. That's not to say I was brute forcing my way through, nor was everything immediately obvious, but I didn't feel like my understanding of these embedded worlds and their relationship with each other was truly tested. 

## Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2

Red Alert 2 was not my first Command and Conquer game, but it was the one where things really clicked for me. Though dated today, the quality of the visuals as well as the infamously cheesy cutscenes were a huge upgrade from RA1. Of course, Tiberian Sun was released in between that time, so there was a lot of room for iteration. While not as well received overall as StarCraft, I always enjoyed something more about playing RA2. Unfortunately it also did not have nearly as robust of an online either, and in the dial-up days, playing this online was a nightmare. Nevertheless, I had countless fun beating up on the computers, I believe even working my way up to winning 1v7 against the hardest difficulty.

The AI in this game was not great, and eventually predictable as you learned its tendencies, but that only seemed to make it more fun for me. It was less about deep strategy and instead about seeing all of the different ways I could launch my final assaults on the opponent. I loved that you could steal intel from the enemy and be able to build units from another faction. Each country having its own special unit added to the replay value, and then an entire new faction was introduced with the expansion. It’s not the deepest RTS out there, but it’s undoubtedly a lot of fun.
