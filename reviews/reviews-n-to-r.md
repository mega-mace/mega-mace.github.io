## NieR: Replicant ver.1.22474487139...

NieR Replicant is a remaster from the early 2020s of a game from the early 2010s that feels like it belongs in the early 2000s. If you squint, you can see some similiarities to Zelda games of the time, but not in a flattering way. Like the worst Zelda impulses of the 2000s, the beginning of the game is a bit "tutorialized", with you having to go back and forth around your village, talking to helpful guide characters. But then it sets in that this goes on for the whole game. Of course eventually the trips back to the library become further apart, and you get out a bit more in the world, but it's a pretty small map that reuses locations a lot. I felt like it's sort of stuck never getting out of second gear (or at least not in the 20+ hours I lasted).

There are "dungeons" in the game, but they're not the most puzzle-y variety (some basic block pushing, grabbing keys, etc.). The game's combat is _okay_, but I didn't find a lot of actual change in feel between the numerous weapons, and the targeting/camera aren't great. There's some emphasis on combos, but the button inputs aren't as challenging as a true hack-n-slash game, so I just ended up mashing/holding the same button a lot. There are some sections that are a bit bullet hell-like, which would've been a potentially cool gimmick to lean further into.

Other outdated elements in Replicant include having discrete save points, which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't often near the middle/end of a dungeon rather than the beginning. There are lots of side-fetchquests as well, which also wouldn't be so bad if not for a high reliance on obtaining rare-ish loot drops. The quest tracking and maps are a little odd as well, but a more minor issue. But above all else, the story and characters just weren't compelling enough for me to push through all the flaws. It's in that era of games where the dialogue is still not great, but not bad enough to be amused by either. I also got a sense that the story was hiding something bigger from me, but I got tired of waiting for the payoff. 

## NieR: Automata

The much more popular NieR sequel ended up being a game that could set a personal record for time taken to beat in my adult life; not in game hours, but months taken from start to finish. When I started Automata up and it began with an action-packed shmup section, I thought that my wants from Replicant were answered. The save points are more reasonable, and the world feels bigger. But at its core are some of the same issues as before, just smoothed over a bit. To be fair, a lot of the reasons it took me so long don't have anything to do with the game. The ones that _do_ also aren't anything wrong with it per se, but they're things I'm more tired of seeing by 2025 than I would've been when this came out in 2017. There's a large number of sidequests, numerous weapons, lore text logs, a gazillion kinds of loot drops for upgrading weapons - the extra parts that almost never end up feeling like they're worth the effort to do, but will nag at me if I don't do at least _some_ (not all) of them.

There is a lot about Automata that became more tedious as I unpeeled it. The initial story is a bit more straightforward than Replicant - you are part of an android unit trying to fight off alien machines on earth to recapture it for humanity - but as it unfolds, it creates that same sense I had in Replicant of the real story being hidden. Likewise, although it might be a little less back-and-forth than Replicant, I would grow to find the amount of reused areas to be disappointing, and the combat (both sword and shmup) to lose its luster over time.

Overall, Automata is a strange, but solid hybrid of gameplay styles that, again, doesn't do a lot wrong, but that I find mostly boring. In an age of uber-cinematic story-driven games, one of the more interesting elements about it is the more old-school-feeling approach to story. It has cutscenes, but not necessarily a lot, often instead choosing to subvert your interactivity during key story moments (i.e. having your abilities glitch out). The dialogue and acting are compelling and sincere enough, but not like some masterpiece. It's less of a narrative filled with "wow" moments and instead a game that drip feeds you things to chew on. I did enjoy this at times, but it's also one of those things that makes it challenging to move forward in, not having a great anticipation for when it's going to all come together. And even when it was all said and done, there are plenty of unanswered questions left.

## Ninja Gaiden (2004)

Before it became cool in the 2010s, Ninja Gaiden was perhaps the original example of a franchise reboot, complete with the cliche stripped-down title. I'm not sure I was even aware of the original NG when I played this, at least until finding it as an in-game bonus that was way too hard for me. This game is also pretty hard too, so it's perhaps a good thing I wasn't aware of NG else I be turned off of the idea ahead of time. I was not and am still not a big player of the hack-and-slash genre, but this was one of the bigger Xbox exclusive must-haves outside of Halo.

Since I don't know much about hack-and-slash, I assume this is a pretty prototypical one: difficult, yet over-the-top stylized combos, with a bit of 3D exploration thrown in. Looking back, they are kind of comically geared towards teen boys and young men, with all the flashy gore, and in this case, some of Team Ninja's "trademarks" with characters like Rachel. But crazy male fantasy or not, ninjas are cool, especially Ryu Hayabusa, who takes it to absurd levels. You can run across water in this game and run up certain lengths of wall sideways, defying gravity. But the gameplay is far from stupid, requiring a lot of dedication to your button-mashing, so that you can remember the _right_ way to button mash to produce that satisfying combo.

## Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2

The second of the hack and slash NG games is one I missed out on when I couldn't afford the generational jump at the time. Now that I've finally played one, it turns out I wasn't missing much. This one cranks up the male fantasy, with more gore and more comically large breasted female characters, but (at least in the four chapters I played) there wasn't much more to the coolest and least embarrassing part: your crazy ninja moves. In fact, for a remaster of an Xbox 360 game, it feels straight up like the same engine, which is good for my muscle memory, but not so good otherwise.

I'm not sure what can be attributed to the Sigma update specifically, but the biggest changes from NG1 to NG2 are a lot of streamlined parts. You get new weapons much more frequently and the options for techniques and upgrades are simplified. Much of your health regenerates after battle, and the number of healing items you can carry is reduced. The purpose and barriers to entry for the shop are reduced with these changes. Further, arrows are now unlimited. These changes can be handy, but I'm not sure it makes for a better game; together, they all made me feel like both combat and exploration were lower stakes.

I thought the boss fights I encountered were all pretty terrible, but it's certainly possible NG1 wasn't much better in that department. Other things that I would've liked to have seen improved just weren't, like the way the camera angle can change mid battle because of how levels are "segmented" with preferred automatic angles. And in the era of Soulslikes, going back to a game without targeting or invincibility frames on dodges can be a little tough. Again this is a problem in the first as well, but if I would go back to one, it would be the one I'm familiar with. NG2 also feels familiar, but far too much so for a next-generation sequel.

## Ori and the Blind Forest

Lots of Metroidvanias are pretty strict adherents to the genre, with clear references to their inspirations, but a glance, an unsuspecting gamer may not realize what they're getting into with Ori. Instead of being confined to caverns and castles, Ori features a lot of sweeping naturalistic landscapes. Precise combat is minimized (something where I think the sequel faltered a bit) in favor of an emphasis on gameplay centered around acrobatic movement. It certainly doesn't reinvent the genre, but these elements help it stand out in the sea of derivatives. Of course there is also still that satisfying element of progressing through new abilities, but the main appeal is its lovely artistic approach.

## Outer Wilds

I honestly had no clue what Outer Wilds was (maybe some kind of camping surival game), but bought the game pretty much on acclaim alone. Turns out it's a space faring adventure game, but "adventure" can have a lot of connotations, and in this case, it's more like an adventure game in the classical sense. That is to say, it's a virtual scavenger hunt of sorts, and just like its 80s and 90s counterparts, it has its fair share of overly obscure clues and sequences.

To be clear, this is a distant relative of such games, taking place in a 3D world with detailed physics, and a time loop concept that adds a layer of challenge - or, in many cases, annoyance. The most interesting aspects of OW are the platforming and spaceflight, but it's so crammed with little challenges due to its microscopic 22-minute loop length that you don't get much time at once to play around with them. It's a game that dares you not to make a mistake navigating or else you might be screwed over for that loop. The satisfaction doesn't come so much from mastering one navigation scenario, but learning to control yourself better enough over time that you are more prepared for the next one. The unfolding narrative is a little like that as well, with those aha moments where things you encountered earlier start to come together.

But it's hard for me to say that things are particularly fun _in the moment_ with OW. The number of annoyances is too high, and there are so many Whys. Why does the intel sometimes not point to the thing it's a hint for? Why is there no suicide button from the start? Why can't I see exact time or advance it more easily? Why can't I save more specific points of interest? I struggle to think of a downside to adding things like this, except one: They would further make the game's underlying simplicity evident. Although perhaps a little ambiguity is defensible, it sometimes makes for annoying repetition, for example: reaching an area where you have to go far from your ship, you might miss some of the intel and not realize it since you can't check outside the ship, then have to come back again on another loop.

I've never been a big fan of adventure games, clearly. Maybe OW is among the better ones, but I'm not the person to say. To its credit, the actual act of moving your character is generally fun (context of the game's progression system aside), and something that wouldn't have been attainable a long time ago. But even as decades have passed, it leaves me feeling like at the core of the adventure genre are still boring games trying to hide that they're boring.

## Perfect Dark

I’m guilty of slightly resenting how everyone always remembers GoldenEye. While I did play a small amount of it back in the day, I never owned it at the time, and ended up pretty much skipping over it entirely for this spiritual sequel. The expansion pak-enhanced Perfect Dark amped up the action with a cool futuristic setting, aliens and a huge arsenal of weapons that still rivals many shooters to this day. Not only that, but you have an interactive hub world that contains fun bonuses like a shooting range, multiplayer challenges, and the addition of multiplayer bots. I don’t even want to admit how many hours I’ve devoted to slaughtering MeatSims with friends. The weapons had so many interesting effects and secondary modes. It was extremely annoying, but also funny to dole out the “drunk” effect from weapons like the tranquilizer and crossbow. You had your one-hit kill guns of course. There was a sniper gun that could x-ray through walls; a rocket launcher you could fly remotely; a machine gun with a 120 round magazine. Gadgets let you cloak or slow down time. 

The campaign works much like GoldenEye, with missions that have no checkpoints, where you have to complete a set of objectives that depend on difficulty. I loved the way there are fail states, like if you kill civilians, or get caught at the wrong time. The way that different difficulty levels occasionally change the structure of the level adds a lot of replay value, as do the unlockable cheats. Completing the levels in time for the cheats was so hard I never even unlocked many of them, but I did persevere through a good amount since a lot of the cheats were worth it, like blazing through the campaign with a full arsenal. It’s a shame that the control scheme is so dated, even with modern ports, because it’s absolutely worth going back to today to see all the novel concepts, including many I didn’t have room to list here.

## Portal

Proof that good things sometimes do come in small packages, Portal crams a ton of interesting puzzles and quirky dialogues into its 2-3 hour runtime. Armed with only a gun that creates portals as you try to escape a coldly sterile lab, it's a surprisingly simple yet complex idea for a game. The concept of teleporting around wasn't new, but it was a technical marvel in the way that it was done so seamlessly with the world, nearly anywhere you could want. Physics play a large role, such as how you carry your momentum through portals, and there were puzzles that required me think much harder than "I'm at point A and need to shoot the portal at point B".

In an era where big budget publishers are obsessed with pushing the scope and length of games, Portal still remains a welcome change of pace. It may not be long, but that makes it conveniently replayable, and there are pretty much no dull moments or filler outside of the expected loading zones.

## Portal 2

Portal 2 is pretty much everything that made the first game great, but bigger. Just not too big... it's still a compact 10ish hours, but better to never overstay your welcome. The thing I actually remember most about Portal 2 is the world design, where you gradually ascend up layers of Aperture's history. It's super cool, as each one has a distinctive design, and is the kind of concept that could only work right in a video game. Of course there are plenty of new puzzles and mechanics, but the impact of seeing the portal gun (not to mention a rogue AI) is certainly diminished quite a bit the second time around. Nonetheless, it still has a ton of novelty and charm. If I had to rank my most cherished games against each other, I'm not sure it would land super high sentimentally as a _favorite_, but the Portal games are so unique as to be among the most _essential_.

## Ratchet and Clank (2016)

Amazingly, the first R&C game I ever played was the newest, 2021's Rift Apart. Ironically, there's a chance I might enjoy one of the earlier R&C games more, as playing R&C 2016 wasn't different _enough_, good or bad, to feel like much more than a stripped down version of Rift Apart.  Nonetheless, it is nice to have a short and simple game to mix things up with, and this wasn't a bad choice. It's mindless action in a good way. One nice thing that stood out to me most was there were some more flying vehicle sections than Rift Apart. 

## Rayman Legends

Rayman is one of those characters that everyone who plays games sort of knows about from the periphery, but is easy to look at and think "oh, another knockoff mascot platformer". And in truth, even after playing Rayman Origins and then Legends, I can't say the characters of Rayman exude the kind of iconic power of Mario, Sonic or Donkey Kong. But in terms of level design and gameplay, he's right up there with those legends, at least in this appropriately-named entry.

RL plays closest to the modern DKC games, and while it's common for me to make comparisons between games unfavorably, I think both are strengthened by the connection. Playing RL felt familiar (in a good way) because of this, and yet at the same time helped me appreciate the design of the newer DKC games more, being able to separate them from preconceived notions of how they _should_ be. 

RL has all the staples of a modern 2D platformer: lots of collectibles, a few secret areas and an emphasis on stringing together short but high difficulty challenges in mostly linear levels. Each level of course tends to have some major gimmick, be it visual or gameplay or both. A big highlight of the game is obviously the music levels, which have a bit of rhythmic timing to them. I also recall a level where the camera had a neat effect like you were looking through an aquarium, but there are so many more. It's one of those pull out all the creative stops games you would not expect to come from an often maligned developer like Ubisoft.

## Resident Evil 2 (2019)

There's definitely a case to be made that the modern gaming industry is too reliant on re-releases and remasters, but remakes? Surprisingly, we don't get that many of them, but if they were all done like Capcom's Resident Evil 2, hopefully others will pick up on the concept. Granted, I haven't played the original RE2 to compare, and I know some RE purists are divided on the directions the series has taken, but I started out with RE4. In 2005, let alone today, the thought of dealing with fixed camera angles, limitations on saving and other dated elements is untenable. The RE2 remake brings us the best of both worlds, taking the over the shoulder control style of the new(ish) games but being restrained on the action.

RE2 is probably the most tense one in the series I've played to date. Just because it has more shooter-like controls doesn't mean it's all about shooting. In the early game, I was filled with a constant anxiety over whether that zombie I shot was really dead for good, or if it even made sense to be shooting them at all. You zig-zag back and forth through the police station, so you always need to be on the lookout for new (or old) threats to surprise you. And just as you start building up an arsenal to feel safer, the invincible Mr. X starts stalking you through the station as you race to complete puzzles, the creepy tapping of boots constantly closing in from the distance.

The highlight of the game was definitely the police station, but as you progress beyond, it was nice to meet other characters. A lot of the familiar RE design and story tropes are here, but I was surprised to see a more personal and grounded story. Following in the footsteps of RE7, Capcom continues to dial down on the campiness the series is known for, but it still isn't completely afraid to embrace the sillier aspects. I was a little disappointed that Claire and Leon's alternate campaigns actually covered a lot of the same ground, but there are some nice little differences that make them worth experiencing for the story, plus a few changes in guns. It's a pretty short game, but with enough variety between campaigns for a nice little replayable package... that is, if I can get over my fear of hearing that THUMP THUMP again.

## Resident Evil 3 (2020)

<details>
    <summary>Click to reveal spoiler entry</summary>

Sandwiched between two great remakes starring Leon Kennedy, RE3 also meets somewhere in the middle of their atmosphere and play style, and it doesn't really work. The more actiony vibe compared to 2 robs it a lot of the suspense, while lacking the exciting potential of 4's various abilities. Nemesis is a much faster and more mobile foe than the Tyrant/Mr. X from 2, but I found Mr. X to be much scarier the way you didn't always know exactly where he was lurking. In 3, I quickly realized how on-rails the encounters were, and mostly just amount to running out the encounter. That feeling of a constant threat pressuring you to navigate your surroundings efficiently was gone.

RE3 was still fun, but it's hard to picture myself having a reason to replay it. The story was also a big downgrade, lacking the character intimacy of 2. Then there's the extremely predictable two-faced squad member and downer ending. While I would assume some of these problems can be attributed to the original game, it still feels like a half-assed take on a good formula.
</details>

## Resident Evil 4 (2005)

Since this was the first Resident Evil game I played, I had no preconceived notion of how they “should” be. Years later, I still have yet to touch many of the RE games, but I do know this: while RE4 might not be the scariest, and it isn’t the most action-oriented, or the campiest, it might be the most perfect marriage of all these things. When I first touched this game, I hadn’t really seen anything like it before, and yet it felt so great to play. 

Though the new third-person shooter mechanics were divisive, RE4 is still dripping with creepy atmosphere, twisted freaks of nature and heart-raising close calls with killer chainsaws. Whether properly “scary” or not, it certainly isn’t for the faint of heart. Yet the game knows when to disarm the tension with trademark RE cheese. Complementing the amped-up action of the gameplay, Leon is dialed up to absurd levels, an unflinching hero who somersaults out of glass windows with ease and whose most cherished weapon is an awful one-liner. Everyone I know who has played this remembers tons of lines, but only by playing them in the context of the game can you truly understand why they’re so funny. It is a different kind of funny than the infamous acting of the first RE game, feeling much more deliberate, but restrained enough not to spoil every serious moment. 

Regardless, the gameplay itself is of course what really shines here. While ammo is not as stingy as its predecessors, it is still scarce compared to most shooters. To compensate for this, there is fortunately a great system to use melee command attacks—suplexing never gets old—and you always have your trusty knife.  Speaking of the knife, RE4 is notable for being the first game I recall widely being able to find gameplay videos on YouTube, both having been released around the same time. I loved those knife run videos, showing the limits of what’s possible. But I stick to the guns, because they’re so fun to shoot and upgrade, plus with the new merchant mechanic, it gives way to a nice degree of exploration for treasures. 

I’ve replayed RE4 a lot over the years, whether it’s with the very fun and overpowered bonus guns or starting over completely. I would say that it still holds up, but having now been remade, I have to think harder on that one. Ironically, one of the more dated aspects, in which you stand still while shooting and move the reticle around the screen, is in my opinion a fun change of pace compared to the centered reticle standard of shooters today. While I’d probably recommend a brand new player to skip straight to the remake, I have a big soft spot for the original since it laid the foundation, and I still appreciate many of its quirks that didn’t make the jump.

## Resident Evil 4 (2023)

When the RE4 remake was announced, I decided to do something a little different: the original was one of my favorite games of all time, so what did I really need to know about the remake? I hadn't yet played any of the other RE remakes, but I knew they were popular enough to be confident this wouldn't be a total botch job. So after seeing approximately zero pre-release footage or info, I got this on release, and quickly went through it.

I'm still debating about how much I truly enjoyed it, but it will no doubt receive a few replays over time like the original. A lot of my feelings turned out to be the opposite of my expectations, particularly after I revisited the original. For example, Leon having more mobility and modern controls sounded great on paper, but there was so much nerfing everywhere else - weightier guns, weaker melee, knives with durability. It was still lots of fun, but I went back to the original and it was so easy to line up headshots; there's this nice snappy, arcadey feel.

In contrast, I gotta give RE4R a surprising amount of credit in streamlining the overall level design. I remember as I was going through and first thinking, "Wait, wasn't there something different here?" and being a bit worried, then gradually noticing more and more cut content. It was a bit distressing, but again my opinion flipped after revisiting the original - most of the cut sections were pretty bad, or didn't make much sense. The remake adds and expands in a fair share of places, too.

Tonally, RE4R removes a lot of lines from the original - most being justified, and many in particular being _dated_, but a lot of the fun cheesiness is gone. However, in true modern gaming fashion, Leon is much more talkative, and spews action hero lines during gameplay instead of just in cutscenes. And it's hard to say anything bad about the new characterization of Ashley. The revamped shooting gallery is an absolute delight, recapturing the goofy spirit of the merchant in a new way. I'm not sure that RE4R fully lived up to my expectations as the definitive version, but the upside is we now have two different ones that have their place.

## Resident Evil 7

2017 was a big gaming year for me at the time, but Resident Evil 7 is one I didn't play until much later, being the last game I touched in a 2023 RE-blitz to familiarize myself more with the modern iterations of the series. RE7 is the one that kicked off the renaissance, following up the much-maligned number 6. It reboots the series into a first person take on what I assume is the classic RE style gameplay, with some modern conveniences like more forgiving saves on the standard difficulty. 

Horror games aren't exactly my favorite, but RE7 really struck a great balance for me in being tolerably scary and tense without feeling powerless. The gameplay sounds silly when you describe it - i.e. opening big doors with puzzle pieces - but these seemingly dated elements show why sometimes it can be good to look into gaming's past. I loved exploring the Baker estate, gradually progressing through and feeling the tension unfold in a place that becomes gradually more familiar and more hostile at the same time. There's a real intimacy and sense of atmosphere to the adventure, but it busts out some of those depraved and over-the-top RE moments at just the right times. As is oddly typical in RE, it does get a little weaker near the end as you become closer to the source of the conflict, but I can't say there were any disappointing moments throughout this creepy ride.

## Rock Band 3

Guitar Hero walked so Rock Band could run. I imagine this series must have arisen from someone doing unofficial karaoke while playing GH, and then being like well let’s also throw in some plastic drums. It’s such a simple and obvious iteration, and yet it made GH pretty much obsolete until they decided to go the full band route to keep up.

I don’t really know which RB is the best, but I think I played 3 most? Or it might have been 2. But I also want to say you could import songs from 2 to 3, essentially making it a completely expanded version of 2. The keyboard was also a fun addition, and while I don’t remember ever knowing someone who played the new pro mode, this was at least back when rhythm games had the good sense to keep their changed control schemes optional. 

RB3 might have been released slightly on the downturn of the genre’s peak, but before consumer fatigue fully set in. Now these have sadly become dinosaurs, but they were once so ubiquitous that their appeal likely needs no explanation. Most people, including me, have no musical talent, but these games let you approximate the feeling of hitting the right notes without actually needing to know anything about music, and pair well with alcohol. It may be dead now but ask just about anyone who was a teen or young adult at the time and they undoubtedly have great memories of these games.

## Rocket League

I'll never endorse the idea of hours played as a metric of a game's quality, but if it was, then Rocket League might be at or very near the top of my list. It's your classic multiplayer game where one match lasts just a few minutes but infinite replayability pushes it into hundreds of hours. And even for as much as I played, I'm so far away from the top ranks, but that's okay as the matchmaking is generally quite good at giving you a fair game.

RL is one of those games that's such a simple concept that you wonder why it wasn't done before: you play soccer driving around in cars that can sometimes fly with rocket boosts. As you learn the game it becomes much more evident how much nuance goes into it. It's not just the concept, but the physics require a lot of delicate balancing, and Psyonix achieved something that truly feels great. I didn't start on this game until it had already been out a few years, but I don't recall seeing a single patch that changed the physics, a testament to how much they got it right. Of course, I know that it actually _was_ attempted before, at the very least in Psyonix's own Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. I never played this predecessor, but they no doubt learned a lot from the first draft, especially in marketable naming.

About the only complaints I have with RL are bigger industry problems: the game has taken on various forms of predatory microtransactions, and they love to make a lot of fun alternate modes only temporary. At least the microtransactions are only cosmetic, and the permanent game modes are still fun after all these years.

## Rocksmith 2014

Rocksmith is admittedly less of a game and more of a gamified interactive teaching tool. At a surface level, it comes off as being Guitar Hero with a real guitar, but the emphasis is much more on building accuracy and technique, with scaling custom difficulty and a lack of miss penalties. I had to give RS a shoutout since it actually got me into learning guitar, and there’s something to be said for that. It’s a bit of a non-traditional path, as most people start on acoustic, and naturally this is more attuned to electric guitar songs since it scores based on the pitch directly from your pickups.

Like all music games, one unfortunate aspect is that you are the liberty of licensing, at least without modding your game, and even then you still need someone to be willing to chart it. It hurts a bit more in this one too since you actually want to learn the songs instead of being more about the party aspect. Speaking of which, this game does actually allow two players, and there are a number of mini-game modes, though for me, the focus was more on simply playing through songs to hone my skills and use the virtual tones.

## RollerCoaster Tycoon

RollerCoaster Tycoon might be the first game I played (though certainly not the first to exist chronologically) that convinced me that PC gaming occupied its own space with certain advantages over console gaming. The “tycoon” genre, involving simulated management at a large scale, is one of those that begs to be played with a mouse and keyboard. Given it had been around a while, most famously with SimCity, it’s a bit of a surprise that RCT was my major introduction to it. I’m not a big fan of rollercoasters in real life, and of course it’s a game out of my wheelhouse in general. I think it might have been my non-gaming dad, of all people, who took notice (in a PC magazine or something?). RCT also could be retroactively considered an indie game, being mostly designed and developed by one person, so it’s just an all-around surprise. 

Perhaps the way it got into so many hands is because it’s just so good, and word-of-mouth spreads. Even if you don’t love amusement parks, most people are at least familiar with them, and probably like at least one part of them. If you hate standing in lines and experiencing high g-forces in questionable harnessing, then it’s a lot more fun to watch a virtual vomit-inducing rollercoaster. Even better is when you _created_ that coaster. I remember I’d try to build as big of a drop as the game would allow, though not intentionally as an extreme coaster, as my young mind only understood loops to be “extreme”. The game keeps you grounded with its objectives, and it’s a nice balance of the management aspects and the fun of ride design. Of course, that didn’t stop a ton of people from messing around and making high powered death coasters. Not me though. _Definitely_ not me.

## RollerCoaster Tycoon 2

There isn't much to say about RCT2 that I haven't already said about the first game, as it admittedly feels more like a third, extra-large expansion pack. Of course it has the obligatory new rides, new parks, new decorations, etc., but it still plays out more or less the same, and even looks similar. The big thing I remember about RCT2 is that it included real world Six Flags parks. While most people would probably be interested in seeing the digital recreations of the parks they know, for me I dreamed of the reverse: someday visiting the parks in real life as made famous by a video game. Update: I’m still at zero visited. To be fair, wasn’t my biggest dream. For as much as I love the RCT games, I still don’t have a particular affinity for amusement parks. But both of the original two games are equally fun and help you get a feel for what makes amusement parks so compelling.
