## Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga

I got through about half of this game until I ran up on the release of the next one on this list, and by the time I could've gone back to it, I decided there wasn't much need to continue. This is the kind of game I played more for the sake of being able to say I played it, which is what I've been trying to do less of this year. I am a medium-sized fan of both Paper Mario and Super Mario RPG, so I thought it would be good to see what the third style of Mario RPG was like, and I did get a decent enough idea of it in the limited time.

It was interesting to learn that developer AlphaDream was formed in part with ex-Square developers, and it shows in ways that I don't know how to explain. At first I was basking in the Square/SNES-like nostalgia, but it wasn't enough to carry a game that can get boring. I'm not sure if it really does anything worse than the other light-hearted Mario RPG games, but my tolerance for them might be lower now. M&L leans even more into the timed action concept than its counterparts, which I would've figured is a logical to place to take them, but I'm not so sure after playing it. The badges felt even more simple, and the timed actions make (almost?) any battle possible to do without taking damage. That's not to say getting a perfect battle is easy, as the most challenging and interesting thing about the game is the simultanoues character control, but overall it's clearly meant to be a lighter game. The first Paper Mario's battle system already felt more untraditional in comparison to SMRPG, but M&L takes it even further. And with a silly but low-stakes story, as to be expected, this one is another game that's perfectly fine but not essential.

## Mario Kart Series

### Mario Kart 64

Somehow I did not know this game existed for a long time, even though Mario Kart is one of the best selling franchises. To be fair, this was only the second one at the time. I was playing Diddy Kong Racing instead, which arguably deserves this spot for having a much more comprehensive single-player mode. The reason I went with MK instead? Because most people, unlike me, do know it much better than DKR. My generation in particular loves MK64, and even 10+ years after release, this was such a staple of college gaming sessions that I think it has to go on the list. There’s not much to say here—everyone knows how MK works, and this isn’t exactly the most advanced one, but it’s fun enough in spite of its flaws. Even if it’s not the best MK by any stretch it does have one power: bringing people together. And it holds up much better than a certain other millennial N64 favorite from this year (see the HM).

### Mario Kart Wii

Just like Smash Bros., Mario Kart is a popular staple of multiplayer sessions for my generation. The big gimmick with the Wii version of course was the wheel, which you didn't need at all, but did provide a bit more natural of a grip as you tilted the controller around like an idiot. I always found this MK to be difficult to master with the control, but it was so ubiquitous it's hard to leave off the list.

### Mario Kart 8

I've had a couple Mario Karts on the list already, but 8 is the first one I've played that truly feels like a great game outside of the party game factor. I'm not even sure I knew about drifting in MK until I played this one, because it's either much more complicated or just not highly emphasized in others. But in 8 it's in this perfect sweet spot of being easy enough to execute while providing a good skill curve. You of course will still get some of the typical MK item/rubber-banding nonsense, but the mechanics are so finely tuned it's easy to put up with. And with a huge course selection and roster that even includes games outside the Mario family (Link is here!), it really is the ultimate MK game. Plus you can race in antigravity! 

## Mario Party

Mario Party has never been an exemplar of Nintendo’s typical quality: the graphics don’t particularly stand out, many weird design choices have been made over the years and fundamentally the game just has way too much basis on luck. But anyone who has played a significant amount of any MP game knows that it’s less about the game itself and its purpose as a way to get people together to play something. You have to know not to take it too seriously and expect some ridiculous garbage to happen and just ride along. 

The first one almost certainly is not the best, but it definitely isn’t the worst either. I’ve played enough of 2 and 3 (and not many others) to say they’d rank higher in a vacuum, but number 1 gets the spot for simply being the one I played most. Not every entry on this list is a paragon of the medium’s power; many are just a source of simple, dumb fun, and this one is probably the dumbest. That being said, the mini-games do provide some nice variety, even if you see them all pretty quickly, and can get past the over-reliance on button-mashing and stick-rotating. There is still a small element of strategy and it can be satisfying to pull off a successful star steal or a clutch mini-game win. The various bonuses and unlockables do take a decent amount of effort to achieve. These early MP games also have some unintentionally hilarious voice samples, mainly for Luigi and Wario, which provided me a great deal of amusement.

## Mega Man (Classic) Series

### Mega Man 2

Yet another NES sequel, but instead of being the risky jump from a smash hit, MM2 is more of your consummate sequel: it took a decently successful game and ironed out many of the flaws, creating something that was familiar but refined in every way. MM2 established a lot of conventions for the series, like the general look and feel of menus, the 8 boss standard and the concept of a fortress culminating in a capsule boss rush before the final battle. It also is a game that lacks refinement of its own in many ways. Some of them are annoying (those Wily 1 platform jumps), but others somehow only seem to enhance its legacy. Take the metal blades, one of the most overpowered weapons in all of gaming: effective against the highest number of enemies in the game, shot penetration, multi-directional, all while consuming barely any energy.

Later MM games would start balancing the weapons and bosses to having only one or two weaknesses each. This approach makes sense, but for my money, there is something fun about MM2; it doesn’t need to be super hard like the others to be enjoyable. It’s also a bonus to not have to pull out a guide for weaknesses since you can just assume that almost anything is weak to metal blades. It doesn’t demand your dedication and attention like other MM games, but if you don’t mind that, sometimes it’s a great one to sit back with and breeze through while you appreciate the music and level design.

### Mega Man 3

The third Mega Man game takes a few steps both forward and backward from 2. Rush was a definite upgrade on the “platform item” concept and gave Mega Man an iconic sidekick. The trend of additional levels before Wily’s fortress started here. And while I’ve never been a huge fan of the slide (especially after playing MMX, it is begging to have its own button), it doesn’t hurt to have a little bit more maneuverability. 

On the other hand, this MM is perhaps the most plagued by technical problems. It’s not major, but whenever I play it, things like the collision detection and the slowdown feel 5% more off than usual. The Wily stages are empty, and the Doc Robot fights do not feel right at all. It is one of the rare early instances of an entry from a reputable developer that feels noticeably unfinished. But aside from those problems, the music is still on point as ever, and the Robot Master stages are textbook Mega Man. It’s a great half a game that takes a big nosedive, but I’m a sucker for Mega Man, so it’s on the list. Deal with it!

### Mega Man 4

Four entries in, Capcom delivered their first truly polished Mega Man game. Sadly after this point, with the greater polish came diminishing returns, but I still enjoy number 4 a good deal. This was the first time they tried the villain twist, which while predictable and eventually tiresome, meant getting an entire second fortress. The extra stages in this one weren’t as lazy as they would get in later entries, and even tried a few new things, like autoscrolling stages. During the normal stages there are also secret paths with optional items to find. The biggest change is the introduction of Mega Man’s charge shot, which does throw off the rock-paper-scissors concept a bit, but is not as overpowered as in 5. It isn’t the most iconic entry in the series, but definitely worth checking out to feel a smoother Mega Man experience.

### Mega Man 9

It may be considered pretty cliche now, but retro-styled graphics were once a bold move, especially from a company as significant as Capcom. Of course, it helped that they had a history of actual NES games to draw from, but it still impressed me the way they were able to create such an authentic experience. Everything from the graphics to the sound and the nuances of the physics is an uncanny replication of the NES. As I recall they even purposely included the slowdown that happens with too many sprites on screen.

Mega Man 9 is really more like an alternate-universe MM3. Leaning on the popularity of MM2, the slide and charge shot are gone, and even some sounds are lifted straight from it. It's the core essence of what makes classic MM great, but done of course with 8 fresh new Robot Master stages and a killer Wily fortress. It does have a few overly difficult parts and not as many checkpoints as I'd like, but none of the MM games are perfect in this regard. What makes it perhaps my favorite is that there are virtually no duds in the soundtrack, plus the unique special weapons see many more use cases than previous MM games. While I wouldn't go as far to say it made 8-bits cool again - that felt a bit like an inevitable zeitgeist - it is one of the earlier retro revivals I can think of.

### Mega Man X

The Mega Man X series occupies a weird space in my opinion. Other than having different characters and lore, the gameplay in MMX would’ve been a perfectly natural evolution of the “classic” MM series. Instead, they splintered off into two separate series, and while classic MM would have some small cases of identity crisis (should he charge or slide or not?), the X series instead remained relatively consistent due to the freedom afforded by making X a more upgradable character. MMX is one of the few series that really nailed it on its first go, due to being a spinoff, as it really had several predecessors that its developers had a chance to learn from. Much of the classic MM staples are here: tight run and gun platforming, eight initial bosses with rock-paper-scissors abilities, a persistent villain with a fortress to tackle. 

What sets the X series apart from the classic series is that the character of X has much more flexibility, which gives it a sort of built-in difficulty tuning. You can find permanent upgrades to your health, as well as armor and dashing abilities. The story is a little bit deeper, but… it’s still Mega Man. It’s corny. If you play a Mega Man game for the story, it’s more to make you laugh than think. The “___ Man” Robot Masters are called Mavericks now and instead are usually represented as robot animals. It’s very surface level differences, but there is a definite new feel to the gameplay. While later X games would further expand upon ability upgrades, and give the capability to play as secondary protagonist Zero, something about the first one always resonated more with me. It’s no-frills, which has always been a highlight of the classic series, while providing enough fresh concepts to be fun. Another neat thing is that some of the stages change depending on which order you do them in. It was a bit half-baked, but it was sad to see this largely abandoned in future games rather than refined further. But regardless, the game still plays great and is an essential in any Mega Man enthusiast’s collection.

## Metal Gear Solid

Finally delving into one of my big gaming blindspots, Metal Gear Solid is the kind of game that is both dated and ahead of its time. The stealth gameplay leaves some things to be desired, as you can't move seamlessly around corners or move low without crawling, and having a directional button to cling to walls is awkward when it causes the camera to change. But there are also a lot of core principles that largely remain in the template for stealth games, such as many of the guard behaviors. I was surprised at some niceties that are more commonplace in modern games, offering file load recaps, being fairly generous with ammo and having many options for hints. On the other hand, the shooting is horribly dated, if it was even good for its time. Many of the guns are aimed in a circle around Snake, with no vertical look or any consistent perspective. But I sense that the gameplay of MGS is more about its feelings of novelty and surprise rather than satisfying, finely-tuned mechanics. Ultimately this is a game/series that wants to be a movie.

The most obvious way MGS was ahead of the curve was its sheer amount of voiced dialogue, which had to be unprecedented at the time for a major action game. And by having the cutscenes rendered in-engine, it eschewed the "future" technology of its time to end up with something that aged better than the generally favored CG/Live Action FMVs. Now by no means are these scenes beautiful works of art, especialy after 25 years, but there are at least glimpses of intentionality to the direction, shot composition, etc. Even having somewhat of an idea of MGS, I was a little surprised how many cutscenes it does have, but that's not a horrible thing when it's breaking up mediocre stealth shooter gameplay. There is also of course a lot of the famous codec dialogues, which are what flesh out the little details in MGS' themes. The surface level plot of MGS is stupid in some ways (how many times can Snake fight this walking tank?), and the specific anxieties of the post-Cold War 90s feel a little dated now, but there are lots of nuggets on the nature of war, imperialism and the secrets governments hide from us. Of course, there are some cheesy bits to the game, in both good and bad ways, but it certainly doesn't take itself too seriously despite the occasionally heavy material. This wasn't the most _fun_ game, but I did _enjoy_ it.

## Metroid Series

### Metroid

This might be one of the stranger entries on my list, because—yes it’s a classic, but—I’m not even sure if I’d consider this a must-play today. First there were superior sequels, then a more accessible remake, and now Metroid inspirations are one of the most popular indie game genres. Certainly most of this is true of any classic game, but Metroid is especially rough around the edges. Though I’ve played it a lot, first getting it on the GBA Classic NES Series (having missed it on NES), I’ve only done one proper full playthrough. Obtaining a map from the internet is practically mandatory, as the game is full of repetitive corridors that look similar, not to mention its fair share of obtuse secrets.  

These flaws are also what made the game so compelling. There is something appealing in fiction about the portrayal of being alone in an oppressive, alien world. Metroid throws you straight into the action and immediately teaches its once-novel tricks of omni-directional exploration and item-based progression. There are many clunky and frustrating moments along the way, namely how much dying sets you back on energy and there are few opportunities to farm it, but there’s an addicting element to getting back out on your adventure. 

Metroid takes me back to a time when I could play a game without trying to beat it, and that is perhaps the best way for me to enjoy it now. The absence of an in-game map and other innovations from later games make beating this one a tough task. But with an atmosphere bolstered by chilling 8-bit tunes and surprisingly effective plain black backgrounds, perhaps the best thing about the original Metroid is being lost in its world rather than getting out of it.

### Metroid II

The rare retro game I am elevating to this section, I ended up starting this game at an airport without full access to my games, but nonetheless it was on on my (informal) gaming bucket list. I played pretty much every "proper" Metroid to this point (including this one's own remake), but 2 is one I was missing. It certainly isn't the all-time classic some of its brethren are, but it was a solid experience and one of the best I've played on Game Boy.

There are a lot of gameplay improvements over the original Metroid, mostly with the map design, and some items like the space jump I previously thought debuted in Super Metroid. Then some things are still annoying, like being unable to stack beams or select them in a menu. There's also the lack of a map, but at least the game is more linear, as you go around clearing a section at a time of Metroids. I don't think I _badly_ needed a map, but it's the kind of game you need to play through a in a short period so you don't forget where you were going. 

This could've been alleviated by, for example, placing save points at the start of each section as a good stopping point, but it has those kind of dated issues. Aside from the save points, missile and healing items tend to be placed pretty inconsistently as well, and enemy drops for the same can be stingy at times. But at least the game _has_ save and healing points, another upgrade over the first. These are pretty expected issues with a game this age, so the thing that disappointed me most overall is that the music is pretty bad/nonexistent. 

Other than that, it's a very well-designed game. It takes advantage of the limited capabilities of the console to still deliver typical Metroid platforming and exploration challenges. As I got further along, I started realizing some of the subtle navigation cues were pretty clever, like how enemy types can signify changes between sections. Not bad for a sophomore effort in a series that had even greater things to come.

### Super Metroid

Though not the first Metroid game, this is undeniably the true template. It was so good there would eventually be an entire genre named (half) after Metroid, and it’s easy to see why. Pretty much all the conventions that have endured to this day were already here in 1994: the in-game map, the upgrade loops and the sequence-breaking potential. This standard-bearer may to this day still be the best of the bunch. Super Metroid keeps it simple compared to similar games with more RPG elements, but that’s what makes it great. You might rarely find an exciting new weapon, but you won’t find an underwhelming one either—the missile tanks will always be useful. It satisfies two of my biggest impulses when playing a game: character upgrades and exploration. Now of course these two elements are common to many games, but it’s the way they are intertwined in Super Metroid that is special. 

There are no artificial obstacles along the way or pushy helper characters; you are left to figure it out. There are certainly more ideal ways to go, but that’s part of the fun, looking at the world’s subtle cues while not even knowing that you are being directed. And of course, there are still plenty of times I end up going the wrong way. You will hit obstacles in this game, but players more skilled than me have found a way to get through it in nearly every way imaginable.  Even if you don’t have that kind of skill, the adventurous will never get truly stuck as long as they are smart and persistent. I did hit a few brief choke points my first time through, but in comparison to the first Metroid game, it is far more forgiving in this regard without being obvious. 

Like all Metroid games, the lonely alien world atmosphere is here and adds to the experience. More than just an empty world you will see damaged and abandoned locations, leaving clues to interpret their past. More mature and serious than your average Nintendo game, it’s always a joy to go back and explore it.

### Metroid Prime

Metroid Prime probably comes as no surprise on this list, but it is still somewhat of a divisive game in the franchise. While I’m by no means a 2D Metroid speedrunner or sequence-breaker, there is something undeniably snappy about the 2D game mechanics. Many great 2D games hide a layer of complexity underneath their approachable surface. In contrast, I find MP trades in a lot of mechanics in exchange for a greater sense of atmosphere. There’s just something mesmerizing about gazing around the wonderful scenery, enhanced by a lot of cool visor effects, that is only possible with this being a 3D game. Somehow they managed to land on a mood that fits somewhere between lonely and relaxing, and that’s the true beauty of the game.

Gameplay wise, much of the expected Metroid tropes do make the jump to 3D: morph balls, missiles, locked doors everywhere, and so forth. Though it controls unconventionally for an FPS, and has a lot of platforming in a genre that’s not the best suited for it, it’s an admirable effort. Still to this day we don’t see a lot of 3D attempts at an interconnected Metroid-style world, and even though it cheats a bit by making them into more discrete zones, it’s a ton of fun exploring all the ways around. It is a bit heavy on backtracking, but luckily that’s aided by the incredible atmosphere. Someday I dream that we can see this genre reach its full potential in a proper modern, fully continuous world.

### Metroid Zero Mission

Here we go again, yet another Metroid (type) game! Zero Mission is a complete reworking of the original game, and it's fantastic. Though it's certainly far from a purist's take on the NES classic, a lot of necessary fat was trimmed to make this game playable. It's kind of funny to think that the remake itself is now older than the game it was remaking was, but in spite of that, I last played it just a couple years ago and it still holds up well.

The overall core of the original game is intact, with some generally welcome changes. A few of the more confusing and repetitive areas are trimmed down, with a few sections changed to add new challenges. The shooting and platforming are pretty similar at a basic level, but with a few changes that make it feel more like Super Metroid. Of course the in-game map is a key new feature. And though I don't feel all that strongly about it, the brand new epilogue was a significant addition.

Generally speaking I'd recommend ZM, but clearly I still hold some regard for the original, as it made this list too. The original is mostly interesting as a historical glimpse, and if you are actually interested in progressing without much headache then you should play ZM. But luckily enough, the original version is an unlockable to ZM, so it's part of the same package!

### Metroid Dread

The Metroid series has had a pretty bleak outlook since the late 2000s. Even though we eventually got 2017’s Samus Returns, that was a game that felt a bit like it came and went. Then Metroid Dread came out somewhat out of nowhere, not even being the new Metroid game people had been waiting for… or at least, not the one that had previously been announced (Prime 4). Some might say that they’re always waiting for 2D Metroid, announced or not, and it was once again easy to see why. 

By 2021, being flush with indie successors, making a 2D Metroid stand out was not an easy task, but MercurySteam succeeded by handling this with a lot of love and care. The EMMI chases, though at times frustrating, not only upped the tension but gave the game a memorable point that will help it stand out for years to come. Much of the rest of the game is pretty standard Metroid fare, but if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. There are some nice quality of life innovations here, like the ability to see individual blocks on the map once you’ve revealed them. It makes it much easier to know where to go back to with a certain ability without cheapening the exploration. It also extensively hides secrets behind techniques like the shinespark, doing much more to teach you these than any game before. The movement is remarkably smooth. And they threw in enough fanservice for long-time fans without overdoing it; I found myself awed at a couple surprises I came across. Metroid Dread is definitely a worthy addition in a now crowded genre.

## Minecraft

I must have first seen Minecraft in 2009 or 2010, back when it was a web-based beta (or even alpha). I'd see people checking it out on school computers and being just absolutely fascinated, having never seen anything like it before. I realize the irony in that now, as it was pretty much stolen from an existing game, but Mojang did figure out how to make its niche inspirations into something for a wider audience. As time went on, I didn't know a ton about the game, but heard of things like people making functioning circuits, and my intrigue only grew as it approached official release.

Minecraft might be the first game I was so interested in that I had to stop myself _before_ I even played it. You see, I was in the midst of my senior year of college, and with the finish line so close, the prospect of getting caught up in long gaming sessions was too dangerous. And Minecraft is indeed a big time sink, but there was still something worth it to me. There are so many different ways to play the game now, both officially and via unofficial mods, but for me it was always about getting on a server with friends and building up our bases. It could be both synchronous and asynchronous, and you get to see each other build things up over time.

That was the basic process for me, but each map changes your inspirations and comes out differently. We'd typically do that until we got bored, then wait a few months or years, and start all over again on a new map. Aside of course from the procedural generation, the various free updates over the years help to mix it up. I've held on to the data files for most of the maps I've played on, and they will be a treasured way to take a trip down memory lane... sort of like writing this list has been.
