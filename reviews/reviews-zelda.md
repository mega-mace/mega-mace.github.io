## The Legend of Zelda

Let’s get this out of the way: Zelda is my favorite game series, so it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that the first game will be the first of many Zeldas to appear here. Even so, I must admit I was never the biggest fan of it. I did play this at a young age, and it certainly left an impression, but it was one of those games for a child that just feels hopelessly impossible. Even though we had the included physical map, which plotted locations to the first few dungeons, how was anyone supposed to figure this out? I had seen nothing like it (granted, it was probably the less than 10th game I ever played), this huge world, laid out in the open rather than a pre-selected series of stages. Many dungeons simply require you to find the square of the map they are on and walk in, but then later on you need to find the hidden entrances. The second quest further expands upon this; my first time doing that I feel like I used the whistle or candle on every screen just to find the stupid dungeons.

I think part of the reason I don’t hold this as highly is that I did beat (but not play in general) Ocarina of Time before it, and that invites a lot of comparison to the narrative structure, obtuseness (or lack thereof) of clues, and dungeon puzzles. By the third Zelda game and on, these were so fleshed out that the original looks very simple. I understand this simplicity is exactly why many still love the original; there is a degree of freedom to tackling the world that most of the later games gave up in exchange for concepts like puzzles that more heavily involve specific items. And also to its credit, the original Zelda has a lot of concepts that are easy to take for granted now that were less common then—numerous equippable items, permanent character upgrades, a (primitive) in-game map, and environmental secrets.

## Zelda II: The Adventure of Link
Another one of the weird NES sequels, though not well beloved, I actually have always preferred this to the original Zelda. When you first boot this up, it will immediately look different as you exit out of the side-scrolling North Palace, but then… back to the familiar top-down? No, not exactly. Zelda II’s main departure from the original is how it plays like an RPG, where you traverse a scaled down world map, then enter dungeons, caves, towns and other encounters, where it “zooms in” to detailed side-scrolling sections. Admittedly, the side-scrolling action doesn’t _feel_ like Zelda, but when you consider this was the second Zelda game at the time, it doesn’t seem as unusual.

I’ve always found the combat to provide a simple satisfaction, much in the same way Castlevania does, although Link is far more nimble. My biggest complaint (aside from obtuse clues) is that the ability to use items like a boomerang or bow was eschewed in favor of spells, and the few items you do obtain are passive, or only do something on the world map. Having magic isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but this game’s age shows here: aside from giving you too few magic points and not enough places to consistently replenish it, most of the spells serve no general purpose. Instead, they are usually meant to solve a few specific obstacles or defeat a certain enemy. Outside of a town, healing is also strictly tied to an expensive spell, which is usually a downer, since this game is pretty challenging. But you do get extra lives! Overall, I think it’s in some ways easier and other ways harder than the original. It’s not as bad as people make it out to be, just different. Most of the same adventure elements are there, and its different approach to combat is still fun. On the other hand, I concede that the world is much more segmented, so I can see how it totally kills the big open world vibe that made the original special.

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

After the experimental blip in number 2, the third Zelda game reverts back to the top-down formula of the original and enhances it to perfection. Now with an expanded narrative, themes for each dungeon, and a greater emphasis on item-based puzzles, A Link to the Past set the template for Zelda games to come. I didn’t get to play this one until many years later, when I realized how much even my beloved Ocarina of Time borrows from it. Link’s iconic weapon, the Master Sword, makes its debut. More of the history of Hyrule and its key characters is fleshed out, and there is an exciting dual-world concept.

Something about the idea of adventuring through a whimsical world, gradually expanding your strength and arsenal as you slowly gain the ability to visit more of it, never gets old. Nameless elders of the first game are replaced with quirky characters, hiding some sort of secret for you to uncover at every turn. Geographic features and biomes are realized in far greater detail. And of course the dungeons are so much fun. Instead of just being a big maze, they’re laid out like more of a two-part task, first in completing half of it to uncover its treasure, then deploying that treasure to open new areas in the second half. Sometimes it is overly formulaic, but it gives each dungeon far more of its own unique character that lacked in the prior games. The number of items is staggering, giving you all sort of attack options and even delving into magic. My favorite was always the Pegasus Boots, since the concept works great in 2D. The secrets are much more plentiful and meaningful. The game is so great that it might still be the pinnacle of 2D Zelda. 

## The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening

If A Link to the Past is not the pinnacle of 2D Zelda, then Link’s Awakening is its strongest competition. It may have come in a tiny Game Boy cartridge, but this is no pocket-sized adventure. Rivaling the greatest entries in the series, it even expanded on many of the concepts of its SNES predecessor. Underneath the GB limitations, it feels a bit like a hybrid of Zelda 1 and ALttP, with its newer control and design style, but packed into single-screen chunks. One of its biggest strengths is its existential story and oddball characters, straying far from the usual clichés of the series, while keeping the gameplay right at home. Something is absurd yet strangely moving about playing a song to wake a giant whale from an egg.

My biggest annoyances with the game do come from the limitations. While the single-screen design makes for some neat puzzles in the dungeons, it’s not as fun in the overworld, where you often find yourself chasing all the way around a one-block wide obstacle. This is rectified somewhat in the remake, though the obstacles remain, and you can just see beyond them more easily. The constant switching of the buttons is also annoying, and also fixed in the remake. Both versions are great ways to enjoy the game, but I think the original gets a slight edge for laying the foundation. There is also something very moody about the sparse Game Boy visuals and sound that enhances the atmosphere.

## The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

Along with Final Fantasy 7, it feels like Ocarina of Time practically invented the “Best Game Ever” discourse—not necessarily as a testament to their unprecedented quality, but the combined maturations of games journalism, internet discussion and the industry itself reaching a point where it was a valid question. Regardless, coming in with a decent respect of its predecessors (not just in Zelda but gaming as a whole), when OoT dropped I fell in love pretty much instantly, and it remained my single favorite game for a long time after. There was just one foundation-shaking innovation after another. I don’t know if OoT invented all of these things, but I think it popularized them for many people who, like me, experienced them for the first time through it: a rolling day-night system, horseback riding, Z-targeting. I remember reading about “Zelda 64” in a gaming magazine, in its early stages, being enticed by the teases of the day-night shift and your horse. It felt like a dose of realism I couldn’t wait to see. 

And those weren’t even the most memorable parts of the game in the end. OoT is fundamentally great because it’s built on a strong formula established mainly in A Link to the Past. But this is not to say that it is lacking in uniqueness, as the dungeons were unlike anything I had seen before, and I was invested in a 3D world in a way that 3D games to that point didn’t achieve. I don’t even think I fully grasped it at the time, but the most understated achievement is its immersive story. While games like FF7 have a much more ambitious story, OoT was equally effective at eliciting an emotional response from me by pulling me more directly into the action. It was the first game I had played that had a cinematic direction to key scenes. This is an interesting contrast of the technology at the time—PS1 games typically opted for FMVs, which were much flashier, but often pulled you of the game with live-action actors or CG that didn’t match the style of the game. I don’t say this to knock the PS1, or say that OoT is to credit for the popularization of in-engine cutscenes, but it was a great example of Nintendo using the system’s weaknesses as a positive.

Due to how I was pulled into the world, OoT was also the first game where I really wanted to explore everything, see what every minor character was up to, find every little secret. It’s brimming with so much life and mystique; a tiny glimpse at the ultimate potential of open-world adventure, but also a fantastic experience that still stands wholly on its own.

## The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask

Living in a post-Ocarina of Time world, naturally it put my expectations for the Zelda series into the stratosphere. Perhaps I should have tempered expectations a bit, but don’t worry, Majora’s Mask will get its due praise. Following up what I had considered the best game ever, at the time of release, I was a little put off by the way MM takes a different direction. Since then, of course, it has risen considerably in my view, and ironically its deviation from OoT is actually what makes it a better Zelda game than its successors (until BotW) in my eyes. Initially seeming familiar, with many character assets lifted straight out of OoT, many things understandably threw off 9 year old me. Operating under a time limit led to some frustrating moments when you narrowly miss out on a certain quest (and still is a flaw to this day in my opinion, but perhaps a necessary one). I had considered the adventure far less “epic”, saving some mysterious town from a weird masked… Skull Kid? A random minor NPC from the previous game? And of course, the number of dungeons was greatly reduced.

All of this I came to realize over time is what’s brilliant about it. Compared to release cycles today, it would be a dream to see a sequel of this caliber only a year and a half later, and it’s aided largely by a lot of clever design. The reused assets give way to a parallel world concept, and the operation of events on a repeating schedule allow the world to feel bigger than it is. Link’s journey is much more about the stories of the individuals he meets along the way. The diminutive villain is a testament to the power of the mask, showing that anyone can be consumed by evil. The dungeons are far more polished and lack the tutorial filler of OoT, giving you great bang for your buck with only four. And it’s not fair to compare the two games without crediting a lot of the great new stuff added in MM: geographical areas that feel super fresh, more complicated sidequests and of course, transformation masks. I’ve gone on to replay MM several times and always enjoy this essential Zelda experience.

## The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker

Ocarina of Time already got a follow-up, but it wasn't until the GameCube that we would get a glimpse of a new generation of 3D Zelda. Count me in the camp that was hoping to see a more traditional and "realistic" style, only to be massively disappointed when the cartoon cel-shaded style was revealed. Looking back, was I really that disappointed, or just coping because I couldn't convince my parents to get me a GameCube? Or was I being a typical preteen boy and afraid to like something less "mature" than expected? 

The answer is probably all of the above, but in any case, it may have worked out that I didn't get to play it until later (I think possibly not even until after Twilight Princess). Removed from the original expectations of the time, with fresher and more mature eyes, I saw it for the great game it is. Though far from my favorite, it checked most of the expected boxes of that era of Zelda. The cel-shaded look makes Toon Link perhaps the most expressive version of the character. It was nice to see Zelda (the character) starting to get more involved in the story.

There are some quirky aspects to the gameplay, like the amount of dungeons, and the way you progress. The Great Sea is certainly a neat idea, and though going around to all the islands was fun, I've always thought the map would've been better off a little smaller. Exploring a contiguous landmass tends to be more fun in the end, but the sea exploration and the plot concept of a flooded Hyrule were nice for a one-off. 

Somewhere as a mid-ranking 3D Zelda, it didn't give me the same emotional hold as the ones before it, but it is a charming one that introduces lots of new concepts. And with a remaster that smooths over many of the flaws, while showing that the graphics aged better than a more realistic alternative, it's definitely still worthwhile. 

## The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

Twilight Princess might remain one of the most hyped moments ever from E3: after the cartoonish Wind Waker, they delivered a trailer that showed a far grittier, more realistic take. I was intrigued, but sometimes my mind proves to be fickle, or games just disappoint. It wasn't a bad game obviously, but I couldn't help but think it was an overcorrection, with the twilight theme trying to exude some kind of dark themes that didn't quite land. It was one of those things in the game that felt tacked on. Others just feel out of place, like Wolf Link.

It says a lot about the quality of Zelda games that a disappointment can make my top 100, but TP is at its best when it's playing safe, leaning heavily on what makes its predecessors great. Each time I've replayed it, tuning out the more annoying/tedious parts since I know what to expect, it feels a bit more like a soft reboot of Ocarina of Time - though yes, an argument can also be made that OoT lifted a lot from A Link to the Past. Some of it is more superficial, like the theme/ordering of forest-fire-water dungeons, but I can't help but feel things like the choice for a more adult Link were a deliberate callback. Horse riding returns, with expanded combat options, but there are sequences of the game where they're clearly trying too hard to showcase it.

TP does have a lot of cool dungeons, at least thematically, even if they started to take a more linear approach. It also stands out from OoT and others with a lot of unique items. I was disappointed that many of them didn't have a wider use, but can't deny they were fun and differentiate the game a bit more. There were certainly some epic story moments, even if a few left me scratching my head. There's just something I've always found "off" about this game in a way that's hard to describe, but it's a great game in the grand scheme of things, and has got all the ingredients of a classic 3D Zelda, however oddly they came together.

## The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword

Ah, the old standby makes it on the list once again, yet might be the weakest of this year, amongst these more novel new(ish)comers. Skyward Sword is a game I once loved considerably, but realize now maybe it was just one I badly _wanted_ to love. In a post-Breath of the Wild world, it has unquestionably looked weaker with time, but before then it was the most ambitious at trying to bring new things to a stagnating series.

A lot of the new features unfortunately don't land. There are a few new challenges around the stamina, but it feels pretty half baked. I didn't have a ton of trouble with the sword controls, but it would be naive to act like they were problem free. I still think they were a net positive, bringing some much-needed change to combat that had gotten too button mashy, but clearly best left as a one-off. More minor Wiimote features like aiming were nice when they worked right, but not a game-changer. Crafting was inoffensive but a bit of a waste of time.

Sadly, many things didn't change, and if anything some of the weaker elements of this era of 3D Zelda were doubled down on, like overzealous helpers, rigidly limited exploration and questionable filler quests. I actually didn't mind the concept of navigating the surface only through sky points too much in theory, but both sky and surface world felt a bit underdeveloped to truly pull this off.

I do still like a lot about SS, like the concept of Link being a school student, and much of the world-building as an origin story, aside from some cop-outs on introducing a new villain. The dungeons are still largely great, and the sky was an all-new setting. An occasional brilliant mechanic like the time stones shows up. Even as SS falls in my rankings with time, I can't help but feel it remains a misunderstood, and possibly underrated entry.

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds

The 3DS (maybe, still TBD) was one I thought would get caught up in my selling spree, so it was time to give this one another shot before possibly shipping it away. I played it many years ago when it was fairly new, and it was fine, but that's all. The fundamental gripe I have with A Link Between Worlds is that it's too much of a requel, playing like a dumbed-down version of A Link to the Past, and my opinion didn't really change on a revisit. You get a near 1:1 of the overworld from LttP in ALBW, but with some much less imaginative traversal since Lorule is sectioned apart and dotted with fixed transfer points. Most of the items are also ripped from LttP, but many are missing - which isn't _completely_ a bad thing, as LttP may have gone overboard with some of them. There is a degree of streamlining in ALBW that is kind of nice, but it's a fine line to walk that often dips into being overly simple.

Zelda games from around the early 00s to early 10s became kind of notorious for gating the player off and pointing them in a certain direction, so I get that the concept of doing the dungeons in any order was appealing. But when the items are all available from the start, and the limited 2D world is rather small, the idea of having free exploration isn't that intrinsically exciting compared to later wide-open entries. I think something is lost with the dungeon design by de-emphasizing items, or maybe they just needed to be longer to compensate for the lack of that "two-part" feeling of a classic item-based dungeon. The dungeons are probably the strongest part of the game, since they are the most different from LttP, but they still do a lot of thematic lifting from the predecessor, which just further begs the comparison in my mind. At least I can say there aren't any real annoying parts of the game, which I'm not sure I could say for a lot of Zelda games before it, but it comes at an expense of being a little too basic.

## The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

Here it is. The big dog. A recurring talking point in this list is my search for a Zelda game that could make me feel the way I did when I first played Ocarina of Time, and finally it delivered. BotW stood out by being very much _not_ like OoT or any of the Zeldas before it, but this was a series getting in desperate need of a reboot. Waiting to write this with Tears of the Kingdom just months out, I’m not sure how long it will last, but nearly since the day it dropped this has held my crown as the best game ever. The older I get, the rarer it is to find a game that leaves me truly awed, but when BotW came out I knew something was special, breezing through over 100 hours in a matter of a couple weeks (it helped that I was unemployed at the time).

Somehow BotW feels like it invented the modern open world game, even though the genre was well in vogue by the time. Most popular open world games are RPGs, which have their merits, but for my money, I love the effective simplicity deployed here. Rather than speccing towards one or two combat styles that shoehorn you to a few types of weapons, you have free reign to use whatever you can pick up. The much-maligned weapon breaking system gives you an incentive to blaze through numerous weapons and experiment, rather than just settling on the one with the highest damage. Even the armor system is more detailed than typical Zelda, even if it’s not the most complicated in the grand scheme, and who doesn’t love a good outfit change? The elemental weakness systems and the enemy variety aren’t as rich as comparable games, but the fun is in finding different ways to approach these interactions with its robust self-described “chemistry engine”. These interactions are always hiding in plain sight, with the game delivering a small number of intuitive axioms (i.e. fire burns things) and leaving the player to find out exciting ways to take advantage of them.

BotW also avoids the open world trap of becoming a “checklist game” full of sidequests where you just follow tracks or go hopping around point to point on the map talking to NPCs. It does have a few quests like this, but I gather that most people just ignored them, because the game is already like one big sidequest. While it may not have the best graphics, I’ve never played a game that comes close to having so many interesting vantages. Seriously, almost anywhere you can stand, there is a cool canyon or lush forest or an imposing mountain off in the distance. The mere act of wandering around the map is fun by itself. In addition to the nice scenery, the climbing and gliding made it so effortless to get anywhere. The Korok seeds that dot the map are a nice way to break it up with bite-sized puzzles that don’t turn into the aforementioned wild goose chases. It’s odd how for technically being a dystopia, I wish I could escape to this world in real life.

I could go on and on, and have already decided to throw the 500 word limit out just for this one. The shrines are a nice take on the dungeon; while not every one of them is a winner, you can go in knowing that you’ll have a good chance of doing a cool little physics puzzle, plus a tangibly useful reward at the end. You won’t find the most compelling characters or story here, but one advantage of having 30 years of lore to build on is that there’s an excitement to seeing new takes on familiar races and factions. Even the more minor NPCs, if nothing else, are executed with trademark Nintendo whimsy. 

This game is so good I haven’t even talked about the main quest, but it’s almost like a role reversal. While the “main” content is definitely worth playing as well, anything you choose feels like main content; it’s all fun. I don’t have a ton to say about the story, but I appreciate the more audacious elements that they brought to the table. I’m fully here for giant laser robots and Link riding a motorcycle. These are the kind of concepts that a game of this caliber can confidently execute, recalling Final Fantasy’s plunge into modernity. It might not have been the “traditional” Zelda some were expecting, but whatever it was trying to be, every piece was perfectly in place.

## Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

Tears of the Kingdom was destined to be on this list long before I even knew I was making the list, when Nintendo graced us with the simple words: "The sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is now in development". Any new Zelda is cause for hype, and usually comes with a new version of Link, but given how things went the last time Nintendo decided to reuse assets and characters for a direct sequel, that might have made me even more hyped. There was some controversy over the decision to reuse the same world, and many of the early trailers didn't show a lot, but I didn't need to see a whole lot more - and my faith that there would be plenty of surprises to see would be rewarded.

The upside to building directly on BotW is that everything that was good about it is still here, but so much more was added. While there's still a case to be made for a brand new world, I enjoyed discovering all the changes to the places I had come to know, and there are many new locales in other forms. The sky is a nice redemption arc from Skyward Sword, proving that there were good ideas hiding in it that just weren't executed properly. The depths took me by complete surprise, and although eventually a bit tiresome, it was amazing to find myself in that hostile world at first, slowly learning its secrets and connections to the surface. Together these different "levels" of the map form a whole second, albeit non-traditional world's worth of content to explore in addition to the familiar surface.

I wasn't sure if shrines would make a return, but they ended up having even more. Just like BotW, there were a few weak ones, but the puzzles were even better. The rune abilities in TotK build on the ones from BotW while being completely different at the same time. I'm still sitting on a lot of potential I haven't fully explored with Ultrahand, but got to experience all the Zonai devices via bite sized puzzles throughout the game. The shrine puzzles in particular have this amazing sense of freedom, where it feels like there is no clear correct solution, to the point that doing it "wrong" feels like it's right. Even in the overworld, some of the puzzles just to get a treasure chest are better than any puzzle in the entirety of many other AAA games.

For me, the highlight of the new additions might be the caves, which take a different approach to the "mini dungeon" concept in comparison to shrines. In a shrine, you get teleported to a magical enclosure to most likely solve a puzzle for a known prize. The caves have much more variance, where you might get a long or short one; it might lean more into puzzles or combat or exploration; the prizes could just be some ores or you might find an outfit piece you can't get anywhere else, all while being in a space physically integrated with the game world. The other thing I loved about the caves is how they show Nintendo must have gotten design inspiration from all over the series, as I think of them as more of a 2D Zelda staple. They have been awkwardly attempted in 3D before, but this feels like the first time they really translated the concept over properly.

Even the story was surprisingly more memorable for me than BotW. It certainly isn't the most intricate narrative you can find in video games, and there are still problems with the dialogue and acting, but it's kind of like Star Wars in that regard. It's a classic tale of epic heroism, with those moments that throw a dramatic emotional weight behind them to keep you into it. Finding the memories themselves might have been a minor downgrade over BotW, but the cutscenes made them worthwhile. There's a similar approach with the boss fights, which aren't always the most difficult, but they're punctuated with cinematic gameplay moments that make them thrilling in a way BotW wasn't.

Just like my BotW review, it's hard to succinctly mention all the amazing things about this game, and I am well aware I've missed some. Suffice it to say, in an era of my life where completing video games can often feel like a chore, TotK reminded me what it truly felt like to get engrossed in something. Rather than forcing myself to play the game, I had to remind myself to _stop_ sometimes, even after hours-long play days where real-life responsibilities were partially shirked. It was the kind of game where even after dozens of long sessions, I'd still make some cool discovery each time I played it. 

If there's any overarching flaw with TotK it might be excess - after a while the amount of shrines, caves and lightroots became a bit tedious, though ultimately I can't say I regretted doing them (at least for one playthrough). Perhaps this can be blamed on pressure to expand on the reused world, but I hope the next Zelda will dial down and combine some of these elements. The size is also not necessary because great mechanics like Ultrahand provide lots of replay value on their own. I wanted to build some cool stuff but ended up barely doing it with how many hours the rest of the game took out of me. But it'll certainly still be there whenever I decide to come back to the game, and oh boy is it worth going back to.

## The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom

Echoes of Wisdom, the titular character's long-awaited (proper) playable debut, attempts to take the concepts of beloved recent Zelda games Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and insert them into the classic top-down formula. The key word here is _attempts_ to. Zelda's starring turn is a broad failure in both concept and execution that could contend for being the worst "normal" entry in the entire series.

EoW is fundamentally held back by its echo mechanic, wherein Zelda can spawn enemies and certain objects that she's learned after encountering them in her journey. This was introduced not just to differentiate from playing as Link, but as an obvious attempt to replicate the Ultrahand building mechanics from TotK. In practice, as a puzzle mechanic, it tends to range from building bed towers to bed bridges to bed staircases (not to mention how the bed is an overpowered healing mechanic so long as you can place one away from combat). There's a little more than that, but most of the puzzles in the game are extremely obvious, and not aided by the fact that if you require a certain echo for mandatory progress, the game will give it to you next to the puzzle, further giving away the solution. Stacking objects also enables you to climb over cliffs and trees that form the boundaries between regions, which cheapens the exploration of the game in a way that doesn't feel exciting like the unfettered exploration of recent full-3D entries.

Of course you can also deploy echoes for combat, which is maybe the one part of the game that's not a conceptual dead-end, but they're no fun in practice. Most/all the echoes seemingly have some predetermined attack cadence, so they often miss attacks if your cadence doesn't match the enemy's. It feels like it just comes down to luck of spawning things at the right time, and I'd often find myself spamming echoes until the timing worked. Or you can eventually just spawn enough to overpower your foe. But the game also offers an option to briefly use some of Link's abilities, and in almost any serious combat opportunities (i.e. bosses) it gives you ample energy to refill your Link meter, which tells me even the developers weren't that confident in echo-based combat. I ended up skipping almost all optional combat unless I hadn't yet learned that echo. Of course, I didn't end up using most of the echoes anyway, due to the aforementioned issues.

Somehow EoW also manages to bring back things I thought we were done with in Zelda. The leadups to most of the dungeons in the game are terrible; there's lots of talking back and forth with NPCs as you might do a very small puzzle or combat zone along the way. It feels like filler of old, yet also a new problem caused by the unrestrained exploration necessitating a way to pad a region out. It also brings back a sidekick, and Tri is an absolutely flat character - admittedly it wouldn't be the first boring sidekick in the series, but is it too much to ask for a higher standard in 2024? Zelda herself also gets the Link-style implicit dialogue, not that I would ask for this game to have even more dialogue, but it's a bit disappointing that there wasn't much exploration of her as a character. There's also some Skyward Sword-esque rewriting of series lore, where familiar story elements are given new names for seemingly no reason other than to disguise either a lack of imagination or fear of breaking free from certain tropes.

What did I like about the game? The ice dungeon stands out as a high point. Most of the dungeons in the game feel like they were formed out of a checklist of familiar Zelda races (i.e. Gorons, Zoras, etc.) and some stupid regional conflict you have to solve for them to let you into it. The less formulaic ice dungeon only has a single NPC to talk to, making him stand out more, and instead of unlocking progress through dialogue events, you primarily climb up a more linearized area where you can't bypass everything with echoes. The final boss of the game was also pretty fun, playing out with hints of being a big squad battle, which would've been a more interesting approach to combat for the whole game. But these two parts are just a small bit of the game, not that different from things we've seen in good Zelda games before, and certainly not enough to save EoW from being a dud.
