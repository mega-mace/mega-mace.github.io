## The Legend of Zelda

It's tempting to say something about how I hadn't seen any game quite like this before, but in my case, this was probably less than the 10th game I ever played. Nonetheless, it is obviously unique and influential. The top down style and fantastical adventure setting with a boy hero recall a lot of RPG tropes, perhaps being part of the genre mislabeling that sometimes occurs to this day. Zelda has a more action-oriented combat style, which made it more approachable in my eyes, with its complexity hidden around its large open world. Instead of progressing linearly as you level up your character, you gain strength by finding new tools scattered through the world, mostly in dungeons.

I had difficulty getting far in this game as a kid, but it's a game from an era where you couldn't easily figure things out on the internet. It does come with a lot of hints to start you out, which is a cool relic to look back on. I still have the fold-up map that came with it, barely holding together on the folds anymore. It tells you how to find the first few dungeons but is filled with blank spaces, which my older sister filled out with more of the map since before I could even remember. 

Even with these tools, I had to come back to it much later to properly beat it. In retrospect, it's not overly complex, but many of its famously cryptic hints start making better sense after you've already figured out the solution. The combat is not overly complex, but it's more unforgiving on damage than later games, and Link has a stiffer move set. Nor are puzzles necessarily complicated, instead being more focused on pathfinding through a maze than mecahnical puzzles. But it throws you into the action with little to no handholding compared to later entries, and you can enter higher level dungeons before you have the proper strength to get through them. And to top it all off, it has one of gaming's earliest New Game+/unlockable hard modes, with its famous second quest ramping up the challenge even further. It isn't my favorite Zelda game, but no other can claim to have the same unrestrained freedom, nor boast being two games in one on release.

## Zelda II: The Adventure of Link
One of the weird NES sequels, I've always felt this gets compared too unfavorably to the first Zelda. When you first boot this up, it will immediately look different as you exit out of the side-scrolling North Palace, but then… back to the familiar top-down? No, not exactly. Zelda II’s main departure from the original is how it plays like an RPG, where you traverse a scaled down world map, then enter dungeons, caves, towns and other encounters, where it “zooms in” to detailed side-scrolling sections. Admittedly, the side-scrolling action doesn’t _feel_ like Zelda, but when you consider this was the second Zelda game at the time, it doesn’t seem as unusual.

I’ve always found the combat to provide a simple satisfaction, much in the same way Castlevania does, although Link is far more nimble. The absence of items like a boomerang or bow being used for combat is felt, but it's a testament to the game that it works with mostly simple sword and shield gameplay. It is a stark contrast to the item-based progression I discussed in the first game, as your feeling of growth comes from leveling, although you do get items that are mostly used on the world map. You also get some spells along the way, with a primitive metered magic system that's a series first nonetheless. Structurally, many of the same ideas from Zelda 1 are still here - you get items in the dungeons to help you progress and make shortcuts, you talk to NPCs for confusing clues, you fight fantasy monsters. It is a bit more rigid in the order it expects you to do things, but isn't obvious about where to go and what to do. The whole thing is familiar yet slightly alien, even in little ways like the lack of hearts for health, but that's what makes it interesting to go back to.

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

After the experimental blip in number 2, the third Zelda game reverts back to the top-down formula of the original and enhances it to perfection. Now with an expanded narrative, themes for each dungeon, and a greater emphasis on item-based puzzles, A Link to the Past set the template for Zelda games to come. I didn’t get to play this one until many years later, when I realized how much even my beloved Ocarina of Time borrows from it. Link’s iconic weapon, the Master Sword, makes its debut. More of the history of Hyrule and its key characters is fleshed out, and there is an exciting dual-world concept.

Something about the idea of adventuring through a whimsical world, gradually expanding your strength and arsenal as you slowly gain the ability to visit more of it, never gets old. Nameless elders of the first game are replaced with quirky characters, hiding some sort of secret for you to uncover at every turn. Geographic features and biomes are realized in far greater detail. And of course the dungeons are so much fun. Instead of just being a big maze, they’re laid out like more of a two-part task, first in completing half of it to uncover its treasure, then deploying that treasure to open new areas in the second half. Sometimes it is overly formulaic, but it gives each dungeon far more of its own unique character that lacked in the prior games. The number of items is staggering, giving you all sort of attack options and even delving into magic. My favorite was always the Pegasus Boots, since the concept works great in 2D. The secrets are much more plentiful and meaningful. The game is so great that it might still be the pinnacle of 2D Zelda. 

## The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening

If A Link to the Past is not the pinnacle of 2D Zelda, then Link’s Awakening is its strongest competition. It may have come in a tiny Game Boy cartridge, but this is no pocket-sized adventure. Rivaling the greatest entries in the series, it even expanded on many of the concepts of its SNES predecessor. Underneath the GB limitations, it feels a bit like a hybrid of Zelda 1 and ALttP, with its newer control and design style, but packed into single-screen chunks. One of its biggest strengths is its existential story and oddball characters, straying far from the usual clichés of the series, while keeping the gameplay right at home. Something is absurd yet strangely moving about playing a song to wake a giant whale from an egg.

My biggest annoyances with the game do come from the limitations. While the single-screen design makes for some neat puzzles in the dungeons, it’s not as fun in the overworld, where you often find yourself chasing all the way around a one-block wide obstacle. This is rectified somewhat in the remake, though the obstacles remain, and you can just see beyond them more easily. The constant switching of the buttons is also annoying, and also fixed in the remake. Both versions are great ways to enjoy the game, but I think the original gets a slight edge for laying the foundation. There is also something very moody about the sparse Game Boy visuals and sound that enhances the atmosphere.

## The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

Along with Final Fantasy 7, it feels like Ocarina of Time practically invented the “Best Game Ever” discourse—not necessarily as a testament to their unprecedented quality, but the combined maturations of games journalism, internet discussion and the industry itself reaching a point where it was a valid question. Regardless, coming in with a decent respect of its predecessors (not just in Zelda but gaming as a whole), when OoT dropped I fell in love pretty much instantly, and it remained my single favorite game for a long time after. There was just one foundation-shaking innovation after another. I don’t know if OoT invented all of these things, but I think it popularized them for many people who, like me, experienced them for the first time through it: a rolling day-night system, horseback riding, Z-targeting. I remember reading about “Zelda 64” in a gaming magazine, in its early stages, being enticed by the teases of the day-night shift and your horse. It felt like a dose of realism I couldn’t wait to see. 

And those weren’t even the most memorable parts of the game in the end. OoT is fundamentally great because it’s built on a strong formula established mainly in A Link to the Past. But this is not to say that it is lacking in uniqueness, as the dungeons were unlike anything I had seen before, and I was invested in a 3D world in a way that 3D games to that point didn’t achieve. I don’t even think I fully grasped it at the time, but the most understated achievement is its immersive story. While games like FF7 have a much more ambitious story, OoT was equally effective at eliciting an emotional response from me by pulling me more directly into the action. It was the first game I had played that had a cinematic direction to key scenes. This is an interesting contrast of the technology at the time—PS1 games typically opted for FMVs, which were much flashier, but often pulled you of the game with live-action actors or CG that didn’t match the style of the game. I don’t say this to knock the PS1, or say that OoT is to credit for the popularization of in-engine cutscenes, but it was a great example of Nintendo using the system’s weaknesses as a positive.

Due to how I was pulled into the world, OoT was also the first game where I really wanted to explore everything, see what every minor character was up to, find every little secret. It’s brimming with so much life and mystique; a tiny glimpse at the ultimate potential of open-world adventure, but also a fantastic experience that still stands wholly on its own.

## The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask

Living in a post-Ocarina of Time world, naturally it put my expectations for the Zelda series into the stratosphere. Perhaps I should have tempered expectations a bit, but don’t worry, Majora’s Mask will get its due praise. Following up what I had considered the best game ever, at the time of release, I was a little put off by the way MM takes a different direction. Since then, of course, it has risen considerably in my view, and ironically its deviation from OoT is actually what makes it a better Zelda game than its successors (until BotW) in my eyes. Initially seeming familiar, with many character assets lifted straight out of OoT, many things understandably threw off 9 year old me. Operating under a time limit led to some frustrating moments when you narrowly miss out on a certain quest (and still is a flaw to this day in my opinion, but perhaps a necessary one). I had considered the adventure far less “epic”, saving some mysterious town from a weird masked… Skull Kid? A random minor NPC from the previous game? And of course, the number of dungeons was greatly reduced.

All of this I came to realize over time is what’s brilliant about it. Compared to release cycles today, it would be a dream to see a sequel of this caliber only a year and a half later, and it’s aided largely by a lot of clever design. The reused assets give way to a parallel world concept, and the operation of events on a repeating schedule allow the world to feel bigger than it is. Link’s journey is much more about the stories of the individuals he meets along the way. The diminutive villain is a testament to the power of the mask, showing that anyone can be consumed by evil. The dungeons are far more polished and lack the tutorial filler of OoT, giving you great bang for your buck with only four. And it’s not fair to compare the two games without crediting a lot of the great new stuff added in MM: geographical areas that feel super fresh, more complicated sidequests and of course, transformation masks. I’ve gone on to replay MM several times and always enjoy this essential Zelda experience.

## The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker

Ocarina of Time already got a follow-up, but it wasn't until the GameCube that we would get a glimpse of a new generation of 3D Zelda. Count me in the camp that was hoping to see a more traditional and "realistic" style, only to be massively disappointed when the cartoon cel-shaded style was revealed. Looking back, I was probably just jealous that I couldn't afford a GameCube at the time, so I dissed the game as not being mature enough.

By the time I could play it, being removed from the original expectations of the time, with fresher and more mature eyes, I saw it for the great game it is. The ocean setting will probably always be a bit divisive, but how else do you make a series feel fresh while retaining some familiarity? Lots of the expected Zelda tropes are still here, but sailing was a new experience. The cel-shaded look makes Toon Link perhaps the most expressive version of the character. It was nice to see Zelda (the character) starting to get more involved in the story.

WW didn't give me the same emotional hold as the ones before it, but it is a charming one that introduces lots of new concepts. And with a remaster that smooths over many of the flaws, while showing that the graphics aged better than a more realistic alternative, it's definitely still worthwhile. 

## The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

Twilight Princess might remain one of the most hyped moments ever from E3: after the cartoonish WW, they delivered a trailer that showed a far more realistic take. It's kind of funny how my opinions flipped on both games with time. I was just as hyped as anyone at that time, and looking back find that the grittier vibe doesn't quite land anymore. But of course some of the fickle reactions to Zelda games are only because they set the expectations so high, and TP is no exception to their string of reliably great titles.

Much more than WW, TP is not just a continuation of the LttP/OoT formula, but a return to it. Much like OoT, we get a Link who's a forest villager, although it wisely skips over childhood to another young adult/teenage iteration. The tried and true structure of forest, fire, water objects followed by obtaining the Master Sword shows up here. Link's trusty steed Epona makes a return, but with some much-needed new horse combat. Instead of just the bow you get access to your sword and other items, engaging the mounted monsters that show up in its much larger and more segmented Hyrule Field.

These kind of moments are where TP is at its best, simply being a larger scale version of the Zelda we know and love. I haven't mentioned the twilight areas or wolf mechanics yet because these are relatively weak twists compared to MM's three day cycle or WW's Great Sea. What they do bring to the table is the best sidekick in Zelda. There's a certain degree of anticipation that the game builds, that instead of having the twilight world come to you, you hope eventually to visit it. 

TP also boasts a lot more dungeons than its recent predecessors, sometimes in the late game to the point I wished there was _more_ filler - but it's a massive game overall, crammed with mini-games and collectibles and the series' only instance of heart pieces worth 1/5 of a heart container. This means there are also a lot of dungeon items, some so weird and unique you only wish they could see more use. TP is a big mishmash of ideas, sometimes not always landing perfectly, but it's a game with no shortage of fun to be had.

## The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword

After going to the ocean and then returning to land again, how do you continue to push the envelope in an established series? In 2011, the answer was taking things to the skies, duh. Well, that and a strange little invention called the Wii Remote Plus. I know the result was a pretty maligned entry in the Zelda series, and I can see how it was a breaking point for the formula at the time, but I liked it a lot when it released.

The Wiimote and Nunchuck are centered around just about everything in this game, sometimes excessively, but I thought the swordplay was interesting. In a series where combat was getting to be rather button mashy, the precision swings were a refreshing take when they worked right. It also introduces some rudimentary stamina and crafting systems, elements that would see more use in later entries. There's an odd sense of systems that were destined to be either scrapped or revamped in the next entry, but there's still a lot of classic Zelda underneath it all. I thought some of the dungeons were the best in the series, with some creative concepts like the timeshift stones or the one where the whole dungeon is a sliding block puzzle.

The sky didn't turn out to offer a whole lot in terms of flight mechanics, but I like it as a setting. I can get behind Link being a school student, but most of all, our familiar faces being stuck up in the air with no real knowledge of the world below serves as a cool origin story for the disocvery of Hyrule. The limited way in which you can access the surface reflects either a restrictive design ethos of the time, or a technical limitation. In hindsight, Skyward Sword reflects a need for a refresh, but it helped to plant some of those seeds that would later revive the series.

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds

I played ALBW many years ago when it was fairly new, and came out a bit underwhelmed, but decided to give it another shot on replay. The fundamental gripe I have with ALBW is that it's too much of a requel, playing like a dumbed-down version of A Link to the Past, and my opinion didn't really change on a revisit. You get a near 1:1 of the overworld from LttP in ALBW, but with some much less imaginative traversal since Lorule is sectioned apart and dotted with fixed transfer points. Most of the items are also ripped from LttP, but many are missing - which isn't _completely_ a bad thing, as LttP may have gone overboard with some of them. There is a degree of streamlining in ALBW that is kind of nice, but it's a fine line to walk that often dips into being overly simple.

Zelda games from around the early 00s to early 10s became kind of notorious for gating the player off and pointing them in a certain direction, so I get that the concept of doing the dungeons in any order was appealing. But when the items are all available from the start, and the limited 2D world is rather small, the idea of having free exploration isn't that intrinsically exciting compared to later wide-open entries. I think something is lost with the dungeon design by de-emphasizing items, or maybe they just needed to be longer to compensate for the lack of that "two-part" feeling of a classic item-based dungeon. The dungeons are probably the strongest part of the game, since they are the most different from LttP, but they still do a lot of thematic lifting from the predecessor, which just further begs the comparison in my mind. At least I can say there aren't any real annoying parts of the game, which I'm not sure I could say for a lot of Zelda games before it, but it comes at an expense of being a little too basic.

## The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

Here it is. The big dog. As much as I loved the 3D Zelda games to varying degrees, I spent a lot of time waiting for one that could make me feel the way I did when I first played Ocarina of Time, and BotW finally delivered. BotW stood out by being very much _not_ like OoT or any of the Zeldas before it, but this was a series getting in desperate need of a reboot. Nearly since the day it dropped it held my crown as the best game ever, to be surpassed only by its own sequel. The older I get, the rarer it is to find a game that leaves me truly awed, but when BotW came out I knew something was special, breezing through over 100 hours in a matter of a couple weeks (it helped that I was unemployed at the time).

Somehow BotW feels like it invented the modern open world game, even though the genre was well in vogue by the time. Most popular open world games are RPGs, which have their merits, but for my money, I love the effective simplicity deployed here. Rather than speccing towards one or two combat styles that shoehorn you to a few types of weapons, you have free reign to use whatever you can pick up. The much-maligned weapon breaking system gives you an incentive to blaze through numerous weapons and experiment, rather than just settling on the one with the highest damage. Even the armor system is more detailed than typical Zelda, even if it’s not the most complicated in the grand scheme, and who doesn’t love a good outfit change? The elemental weakness systems and the enemy variety aren’t as rich as comparable games, but the fun is in finding different ways to approach these interactions with its robust self-described “chemistry engine”. These interactions are always hiding in plain sight, with the game delivering a small number of intuitive axioms (i.e. fire burns things) and leaving the player to find out exciting ways to take advantage of them.

BotW also avoids the open world trap of becoming a “checklist game” full of sidequests where you just follow tracks or go hopping around point to point on the map talking to NPCs. It does have a few quests like this, but I gather that most people just ignored them, because the game is already like one big sidequest. While it may not have the best graphics, I’ve never played a game that comes close to having so many interesting vantages. Seriously, almost anywhere you can stand, there is a cool canyon or lush forest or an imposing mountain off in the distance. The mere act of wandering around the map is fun by itself. In addition to the nice scenery, the climbing and gliding made it so effortless to get anywhere. The Korok seeds that dot the map are a nice way to break it up with bite-sized puzzles that don’t turn into the aforementioned wild goose chases. It’s odd how for technically being a dystopia, I wish I could escape to this world in real life.

I could go on and on, even with this review already running a little longer than my typical ones. The shrines are a nice take on the dungeon; while not every one of them is a winner, you can go in knowing that you’ll have a good chance of doing a cool little physics puzzle, plus a tangibly useful reward at the end. You won’t find the most compelling characters or story here, but one advantage of having 30 years of lore to build on is that there’s an excitement to seeing new takes on familiar races and factions. Even the more minor NPCs, if nothing else, are executed with trademark Nintendo whimsy. 

This game is so good I haven’t even talked about the main quest, but it’s almost like a role reversal. While the “main” content is definitely worth playing as well, anything you choose feels like main content; it’s all fun. I don’t have a ton to say about the story, but I appreciate the more audacious elements that they brought to the table. I’m fully here for giant laser robots and Link riding a motorcycle. These are the kind of concepts that a game of this caliber can confidently execute, recalling Final Fantasy’s plunge into modernity. It might not have been the “traditional” Zelda some were expecting, but whatever it was trying to be, every piece was perfectly in place.

## Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

Tears of the Kingdom was destined to be on my greatest games list long before I even knew I was making a list, when Nintendo graced us with the simple words: "The sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is now in development". Any new Zelda is cause for hype, and usually comes with a new version of Link, but given how things went the last time Nintendo decided to reuse assets and characters for a direct sequel, that might have made me even more hyped. There was some controversy over the decision to reuse the same world, and many of the early trailers didn't show a lot, but I didn't need to see a whole lot more - and my faith that there would be plenty of surprises to see would be rewarded.

The upside to building directly on BotW is that everything that was good about it is still here, but so much more was added. While there's still a case to be made for a brand new world, I enjoyed discovering all the changes to the places I had come to know, and there are many new locales in other forms. The sky is a nice redemption arc from Skyward Sword, proving that there were good ideas hiding in it that just weren't executed properly. The depths took me by complete surprise, and although eventually a bit tiresome, it was amazing to find myself in that hostile world at first, slowly learning its secrets and connections to the surface. Together these different "levels" of the map form a whole second, albeit non-traditional world's worth of content to explore in addition to the familiar surface.

I wasn't sure if shrines would make a return, but they ended up having even more. Just like BotW, there were a few weak ones, but the puzzles were even better. The rune abilities in TotK build on the ones from BotW while being completely different at the same time. I'm still sitting on a lot of potential I haven't fully explored with Ultrahand, but got to experience all the Zonai devices via bite sized puzzles throughout the game. The shrine puzzles in particular have this amazing sense of freedom, where it feels like there is no clear correct solution, to the point that doing it "wrong" feels like it's right. Even in the overworld, some of the puzzles just to get a treasure chest are better than any puzzle in the entirety of many other AAA games.

For me, the highlight of the new additions might be the caves, which take a different approach to the "mini dungeon" concept in comparison to shrines. In a shrine, you get teleported to a magical enclosure to most likely solve a puzzle for a known prize. The caves have much more variance, where you might get a long or short one; it might lean more into puzzles or combat or exploration; the prizes could just be some ores or you might find an outfit piece you can't get anywhere else, all while being in a space physically integrated with the game world. The other thing I loved about the caves is how they show Nintendo must have gotten design inspiration from all over the series, as I think of them as more of a 2D Zelda staple. They have been awkwardly attempted in 3D before, but this feels like the first time they really translated the concept over properly.

Even the story was surprisingly more memorable for me than BotW. It certainly isn't the most intricate narrative you can find in video games, and there are still problems with the dialogue and acting, but it's kind of like Star Wars in that regard. It's a classic tale of epic heroism, with those moments that throw a dramatic emotional weight behind them to keep you into it. Finding the memories themselves might have been a minor downgrade over BotW, but the cutscenes made them worthwhile. There's a similar approach with the boss fights, which aren't always the most difficult, but they're punctuated with cinematic gameplay moments that make them thrilling in a way BotW wasn't.

Just like my BotW review, it's hard to succinctly mention all the amazing things about this game, and I am well aware I've missed some. Suffice it to say, in an era of my life where completing video games can often feel like a chore, TotK reminded me what it truly felt like to get engrossed in something. Rather than forcing myself to play the game, I had to remind myself to _stop_ sometimes, even after hours-long play days where real-life responsibilities were partially shirked. It was the kind of game where even after dozens of long sessions, I'd still make some cool discovery each time I played it. 

If there's any overarching flaw with TotK it might be excess - after a while the amount of shrines, caves and lightroots became a bit tedious, though ultimately I can't say I regretted doing them (at least for one playthrough). Perhaps this can be blamed on pressure to expand on the reused world, but I hope the next Zelda will dial down and combine some of these elements. The size is also not necessary because great mechanics like Ultrahand provide lots of replay value on their own. I wanted to build some cool stuff but ended up barely doing it with how many hours the rest of the game took out of me. But it'll certainly still be there whenever I decide to come back to the game, and oh boy is it worth going back to.

## The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom

Echoes of Wisdom, the titular character's long-awaited (proper) playable debut, attempts to take the concepts of the prior two beloved Zelda games and insert them into the classic top-down formula. The key word here is _attempts_ to. Zelda's starring turn is a broad failure in both concept and execution that could contend for being the worst "normal" entry in the entire series.

EoW is fundamentally held back by its echo mechanic, wherein Zelda can spawn enemies and certain objects that she's learned after encountering them in her journey. This was introduced not just to differentiate from playing as Link, but as an obvious attempt to replicate the Ultrahand building mechanics from TotK. In practice, as a puzzle mechanic, it tends to range from building bed towers to bed bridges to bed staircases (not to mention how the bed is an overpowered healing mechanic so long as you can place one away from combat). There's a little more than that, but most of the puzzles in the game are extremely obvious, and not aided by the fact that if you require a certain echo for mandatory progress, the game will give it to you next to the puzzle, further giving away the solution. Stacking objects also enables you to climb over cliffs and trees that form the boundaries between regions, which cheapens the exploration of the game in a way that doesn't feel exciting like the unfettered exploration of recent full-3D entries.

Of course you can also deploy echoes for combat, which is maybe the one part of the game that's not a conceptual dead-end, but they're no fun in practice. Most/all the echoes seemingly have some predetermined attack cadence, so they often miss attacks if your cadence doesn't match the enemy's. It feels like it just comes down to luck of spawning things at the right time, and I'd often find myself spamming echoes until the timing worked. Or you can eventually just spawn enough to overpower your foe. But the game also offers an option to briefly use some of Link's abilities, and in almost any serious combat opportunities (i.e. bosses) it gives you ample energy to refill your Link meter, which tells me even the developers weren't that confident in echo-based combat. I ended up skipping almost all optional combat unless I hadn't yet learned that echo. Of course, I didn't end up using most of the echoes anyway, due to the aforementioned issues.

Somehow EoW also manages to bring back things I thought we were done with in Zelda. The leadups to most of the dungeons in the game are terrible; there's lots of talking back and forth with NPCs as you might do a very small puzzle or combat zone along the way. It feels like filler of old, yet also a new problem caused by the unrestrained exploration necessitating a way to pad a region out. It also brings back a sidekick, and Tri is an absolutely flat character - admittedly it wouldn't be the first boring sidekick in the series, but is it too much to ask for a higher standard in 2024? Zelda herself also gets the Link-style implicit dialogue, not that I would ask for this game to have even more dialogue, but it's a bit disappointing that there wasn't much exploration of her as a character. There's also some Skyward Sword-esque rewriting of series lore, where familiar story elements are given new names for seemingly no reason other than to disguise either a lack of imagination or fear of breaking free from certain tropes.

What did I like about the game? The ice dungeon stands out as a high point. Most of the dungeons in the game feel like they were formed out of a checklist of familiar Zelda races (i.e. Gorons, Zoras, etc.) and some stupid regional conflict you have to solve for them to let you into it. The less formulaic ice dungeon only has a single NPC to talk to, making him stand out more, and instead of unlocking progress through dialogue events, you primarily climb up a more linearized area where you can't bypass everything with echoes. The final boss of the game was also pretty fun, playing out with hints of being a big squad battle, which would've been a more interesting approach to combat for the whole game. But these two parts are just a small bit of the game, not that different from things we've seen in good Zelda games before, and certainly not enough to save EoW from being a dud.
