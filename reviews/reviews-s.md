## Sackboy: A Big Adventure

Another PS+ game, I was familiar with Sackboy, but never had any PS consoles to play a Little Big Planet game on. Platformers are a domain I'm obviously quite familiar with, but how does Sony stack up? Based on this one: pretty well. While I think it will ultimately go down as a fairly forgettable game for me, it generally does the expected things right. The most fun is in the costumes and the top-notch world design, where levels are made out of appliances, electronics and other inanimate objects. The level design can take a while to get going but there are some clever ones later on, and the game is short on frustrating moments. It does have the annoying aspect of locking progress behind collectibles, which is strangely common in linear platformers now, but thankfully I didn't actually hit a bottleneck til the postgame.

The annoying thing about this, of course, is the need to repeat levels if you have to come back for orbs you missed. And again, many games are like this, but I'm not sure Sackboy is of the caliber that made me want to dive back in. I had my fun going through it once, but the levels aren't groundbreaking enough, and the control can be annoying at times. It controls well, but you move incredibly slow, outside of using a cumbersome roll move. I also felt like this game wasn't really meant to be played solo, and while you can go online for co-op, nothing beats local multiplayer, which wasn't a possibility at the time I played. Nonetheless, even alone I still got some decent gaming time out of it for a quick and easy one.

## A Short Hike

This fittingly named game is short, and it's about hiking up a mountain. In order to get up to the mountain, you need golden feathers, which can be obtained through a combination of exploration and completing _very clearly_ Animal Crossing-inspired tasks. The mechanics for gliding around are pretty decent, but it's light on actually testing you. This is at its heart a "cozy game" that hides its lack of substance behind a cheerful demeanor. It's Animal Crossing without the Nintendo polish or sharp dialogue or the ongoing sense of progression that makes it worthwhile. I suppose there are plenty of worse ways to spend your time, but this is one I'll file away as a brief "time-killer" game.

## Shovel Knight

Yet another 2D platformer, and also a game that didn't immediately click for me. I recall a videogamedunkey video where he said that Shovel Knight is sort of like a great buffet in contrast to a fancy restaurant, and that helped me contextualize the guilt of indulging in what others do well that is SK. Maybe an analogy of a solid cover album also suits it: it's built heavily on the shoulders of others, but a good game is a good game.

Still, I can't help but bring up the comparisons, as they ran all throughout my mind when I played it. Mostly the game is Mega Man, down to the feel of the movement, the eight bosses, and even the two main characters having a blue/red motif like Mega Man and Proto Man. The world map is Super Mario Bros. 3. The combat and subweapons are like some mix of Zelda II, Ducktales and Castlevania. The towns are Zelda II, again. The death system takes some inspiration from Dark Souls... wait, that's not a classic NES game!

The framework for SK may have come from a lot of inspirations, but that framework alone certainly doesn't make for a great game. And there is hardly a single flaw with the details Yacht Club filled in to make this whole. It's full of tight, fair level design that iterates over time. The visual variety is nice, with lots of memorable locales and enemies, and the dialogue and characterization throughout the game are fun. Shovel Knight is a suitably simple but effective design. You might feel like you're revisiting classics of old when playing this, but was that ever such a bad thing? And it even includes three bonus campaigns, which were generously offered for free for a very long time.

## The Sims

Evidently, 2000 was a big year for me enjoying PC games published by EA. Of course, this one really needs no explanation. The Sims might be the only game I can think of where I all but gave up on playing without using cheats. Who knew that it would be so realistic to play the “right” way: spending way too much time at a job that never gets you enough money to do all the fun stuff you want. The effectively infinite money cheat was a godsend, since to me the most fun part of the game was designing a huge home. Interacting with the Sims was of course a lot of fun too, though this entry was pretty limited. I got my mileage out of it, but I remember always longing for things like more customization options, online play and romance options that weren’t a random guessing game. I always though it was kind of funny how you could have a family with children, but to my recollection there was no way to romantically link people until you played through the game. So all these households have two bachelor(ette)s cohabiting with some random children? Whose children are they?

I assume a lot of these things were fixed in the sequels, although oddly enough, I never really played any of them. Perhaps there was some fatigue from seeing store shelves filled with seemingly endless expansion packs for the first game—which of course, I occasionally bit the bullet on. In the early 2000s, when my gaming budget was much thinner, The Sims was a great one to eat up time with, but then I moved on. It did contribute a lot to the proliferation of the life sim genre, and I’ve enjoyed a handful of the different takes on it since.

## Sonic the Hedgehog Series

### Sonic the Hedgehog

It’s hard to believe that Sonic was once considered a rival to Mario, but I’ll always have a certain fondness for the classic Sonic games. Sonic delivered something of a platforming thrill-ride that was never seen before, justifying a next generation of consoles even more than Super Mario World did, however gorgeous as it was. You don’t need me to say it: speed is the name of the game. For as many high-velocity moments there are though, Sonic has always slowed things down a bit, and the first game is no exception, with Marble Zone and Labyrinth Zone coming to mind. While the first entry is not nearly as fleshed out or memorable as the sequels, it’s undeniably an influential classic, and one I’ve gone back to plenty of times in spite of its flaws.

### Sonic the Hedgehog 2

Sonic 2 is a dream sequel to the original, maintaining a lot of the look and feel, but full of obvious improvements. In this era of gaming, two-player in console games often meant simply alternating turns, but Sonic 2 offered not only split-screen, but also simultaneous play! Neither one worked great—split screen was far too laggy and Tails is too limited in single-player mode—but it was worth the effort, still being so uncommon at the time. Plus this doesn’t detract at all from the other great additions, like the spin dash and a new bonus game. I played this game tons back in the day, as even though I didn’t own a Genesis myself, this seemed to be the one game everyone who did have one owned. The water in Chemical Plant Zone stressed me out so much… maybe still does, just a little! Sonic 2 was much better designed and infinitely more memorable than 1, although it does have one frustrating flaw: the final boss battle is ridiculously hard since you get no rings. Most of the time, I give up at that point in the game, but luckily it doesn’t stop you from experiencing all there is to offer.

### Sonic 3 and Knuckles

Though I often see Sonic 2 cited as the best classic Sonic game, for me, it’s this one, no question. The best thing about Sonic 3 is that it finally delivered us a save game option. I realize this is not really a big deal now, when most probably aren’t playing this on a Genesis cartridge anymore, but it made the game far more approachable. Remember, playing these games as a kid, it wasn’t easy to get a lot of uninterrupted time, especially when I didn’t own my own game and had to play it at a friend’s house. Playing a game in one sitting was a tough task. The other positive side effect of adding saves is that there was no reason for the game to have permanent game overs anymore, further adding to its accessibility.

Okay, so what does that have to do with anything? Sure, these things could be said about a few games on this list, but I felt like it was something worth mentioning at some point, and in this case I don’t have a ton to say about the game itself. Even without the save factor, I think this would still be my favorite just for also having more characters, more bonuses and more power-ups than before. It’s even double-sized! Maybe that is cheating a bit, but through Sega’s remarkable lock-on technology, they were able to make Sonic 3 and Knuckles two games in one. And considering it is widely regarded/originally intended as a single game, that’s how I’m counting it too.

### Sonic Mania

Depending on your point of view, Sega either "allowed" or "relied on" fan developers to make this game, and in turn that probably says good or bad things about them, respectively. But one thing that isn't up for debate is that everyone looking for some good classic Sonic loved this game. Truthfully, I've been too disinterested in 3D Sonic to experience it for myself, but from the outside it is clear the series has been in some pretty dire places. Even a lot of the newer 2D attempts fell flat, but this one knocked it out of the park.

The biggest weakness with Sonic Mania is that it's highly derivative, but that's also why it works. It would be a bit hypocritical of me to knock it points while listing Mega Man 9, as both games take the safe play of revitalizing something by returning to its roots. It was also hard for me to justify not listing it while listing the three core Genesis games. In a vacuum, Mania is probably the best of all, having a quarter century-ish of industry design lessons to apply for a super-polished product. But it also doesn't really have exhibit a lot of innovation over that time period either, even partially relying on remixed levels from those originals. Its greatest strength is simply being a nice nostalgia trip with a great mix of new surprises.

## StarCraft

I was never great at StarCraft, but it was fun anyway, with its diverse race options, memorable voice lines and CG cutscenes. Luckily, it had a huge support base of user-created content. But wait, didn’t I say no user content on here? Well in SC, it was more like a level editor, so I think that’s different. Actually, I believe it even came with a level editor, though it probably isn’t what everyone used to make maps. More importantly, the ability to play user-created maps was a stock part of the game, no mods required.

So yeah, even if I couldn’t get super into playing SC the proper way, there was an endless amount of fun variants that still provided a great taste of the game’s unit mechanics. I think it actually introduced me to the concept of tower defense games, which were always my favorite, but there are all kinds of possibilities; I remember one that was based on Pac-Man. I need not get too much into what users would make, as that’s outside of the bounds of what the game actually delivered to us, but the key takeaway here is Blizzard making it very easy to access user content. And of course there’s also a great RTS with a lot of depth that comes with it, if that’s your thing.

## Stardew Valley

In the back of my mind, since I never played any of the Harvest Moon games, I always wondered "How much does this shamelessly rip off from Harvest Moon?". I'm not sure why, as whether or not it did, this modern top-down farming simulator is clearly a labor of love. Its development history alone is fascinating to me, something of an aspirational and inspirational (but also harrowing) tale of a single developer's passion and willingness to take personal risks for his career. Stardew Valley fittingly begins by reflecting that dreamer inside of us, as your humble farmer escapes their dreary but presumably stable corporate job to start a new life.

Funnily enough, SV would go on to not only eclipse the vestiges of Harvest Moon, but inspire a slew of imitators and knock-offs of its own. While I haven't played these imitations, it's hard to imagine that they could come close to the depth SV offers. Not only is there a lot of variety to the gameplay to mix up each day (farming, fishing, mining, and all sorts of other exploration, not to mention socializing), but the characters have a surprising range. It's willing to portray darker elements of humanity, like depression, addiction, homelessness, family conflict and more. Of course, centered at the core of the game is the fight to rebuild the town's community center. You can improve it on your own terms through various tasks in the game, or throw money at Joja Mart - owned by the soulless corporation you worked for in the prologue - to fix the problems.

At its core, SV is still a pretty laid back game, but what I feel the imitators fail to realize (at least going off their marketing) is there is more to it. It's not a cash grab trying to take advantage of perceived trends; as a single person's passion you see elements of his ethos. SV does unabashedly embrace the silly, "video-gamey" aspects while also delivering commentary, packaged up in an imperfect but romantic little farming community.

## StarFox 64

I’m pretty sure this was the first N64 game I ever played. I could’ve sworn it was sold in a bundle with the console, but I can’t find any evidence of such a thing existing. Regardless, I know at least the game itself was definitely bundled with the Rumble Pak, making it a hot ticket item. It turns out, the Rumble Pak was mostly just an undercooked gimmick, but fortunately they included a great game with it!

SF64 is one of those games that proves a great game transcends genre. I think I’m far from the only fan of it who doesn’t really play on-rails shooters in general. Perhaps only due to a combination of the Rumble Pak as well as the N64’s general lack of top-shelf games, I’m glad it came into my hands either way. A true “easy to beat but difficult to master” game, I’ve had countless fun exploring the different routes and trying to beat my scores. I don’t even want to admit how many tries it took me to finally get all of the medals (but to be fair… I was under 10 years old). I’m not even sure I ever got them all on Expert mode! It really tests your abilities, but you can push your limits in this game on normal just figuring out the best way to ration your bombs and charge shots. 

This might also be the first Nintendo game to attempt full voice acting, something that they still to this day hesitate with. I don’t need to get into the memes of course, but this thing is just sprinkled with quotes I still think of after playing so much. The acting isn’t great, but it’s not at a level of “so bad it’s good” either… it’s somewhere between corny and good, but all I know is I can’t get enough. You might say when it comes to quoting StarFox, I CAN’T STOP IIIIIT!

## StarTropics

It’s easy to say that StarTropics is just a Zelda clone—and not really inaccurate either, but it’s a great one. Even… gasp… better? than either of the proper Zelda games? Now I can’t claim that it is more significant, or overall cleverly designed, but I personally always had more _fun_ with it. The basic premise is that it’s Zelda, in the modern age, with a bunch of American-centric references and an adventure revolving around alien abduction, even complete with its own boy (teenage) protagonist, Mike Jones.

The gameplay is sort of a stripped-down hybrid of Zelda 1 and 2—you traverse through a Zelda 2-style world map, then enter zoomed-in dungeons along the way that resemble the first Zelda’s top-down style. Mike attacks with a yo-yo (later upgradeable) that functions much like the sword, and along the way you can pick up a few special weapons that provide some added range and other abilities. The main departure from Zelda is that these are only temporary, picked up in each dungeon in fixed spots and then gone afterwards. This is because the game is structured linearly overall. You can get some permanent upgrades to your hearts along the way, but by the end of the game it will max your health regardless. Likewise, there are a few puzzles in getting through the overworld, but overall there isn’t much in the way of proper exploration.

Ultimately then, StarTropics is mainly about the dungeon experience. They aren’t as filled with secrets as Zelda, but provide their own approach to puzzles and deception. Much of the game revolves around jumping on tiles, which I promise is more interesting than it sounds. You are limited to moving on a grid, which can be jarring coming off Zelda, but it adds a fun element of timing and patience. Some may prefer the sequel, which has unrestricted 8-direction movement, but in my opinion it added too much precision into a genre that isn’t suited for true platforming. But the coolest thing about StarTropics is the in-game revelation of a progression lock that can be found by dipping a physical letter included in the game in water—good thing we bought a new copy at the time since there was no internet!

## Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order

Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is a game that, on paper, I shouldn't have liked as much as I did. Right off the bat it hits you with a lot of (predominantly Western) "AAAisms" as you go through an Uncharted-esque action sequence, cinematically jumping and climbing through some scripted platforming, as your character quips throughout, until you get hit with a long and detailed cutscene. These are not inherently bad things, but ones that to me often signal a game that prioritizes its presentation over mechanics. Luckily, first impressions can be deceiving sometimes.

Once you get past the prologue, JFO opens up more as something of a 3D Metroidvania with Souls-inspired combat. It isn't the most innovative game, but structurally has a lot of things I like regarding the way you build up over time, with new abilities opening up possibilities, and a simplified character upgrade system compared to proper Souls. The platforming is pretty forgiving, but still requires some degree of precision and timing, which is more than can be said of a lot of AAA games. Likewise, while the puzzles aren't amazing, they were satisfying enough since they required a lot more thought than many contemporaries. The combat does have some hiccups (not having a dedicated button and animation for parries makes them tricky), but has some fun elements like throwing enemies into each other with the Force. I'm more of a casual Star Wars fan, but the story made for a surprisingly nice piece of Star Wars media when I was still feeling the sting of the sequel trilogy.

## New Super Lucky's Tale

(New) Super Lucky's Tale is one of those games I'd always see in bargain sections and digital sales and think how it looked like those knockoff "mascot platformers" you'd see so often in the 90s. But I'm a sucker for 3D platformers, and it gets okay reviews, so it's the perfect candidate for a Game Pass look.

After making it only a little into the second world, I'm unclear who the audience is for this - one might think for people who were fans of similar games when they were kids, but it's so basic and easy it might as well be for _current_ children. Only problem is if you couldn't get your child into something better like Mario, why would they play this? It's the kind of game a clueless cheap parent might get cause they think it's basically the same thing as Mario. It's a "knockoff" in that sense, but the gameplay itself is more uninspired than it is overly derivative.

The level that did me in had me rounding up chickens and eggs, which were hiding in plain sight approximately 10 feet away. I gave a few more levels a try after that, but only with the faintest of hopes that something interesting would come up to restore my faith. That kind of menial task wasn't uncommon in beloved platformers like Banjo-Kazooie, but a 2010s product should show more, and NSLT is also lacking in the kind of general creativity that makes such a thing tolerable. The visuals are half-assed, characters are very cliche and generic, and there just isn't that killer design factor that great games possess. NSLT is not technically a bad game, but it's the laziest kind of competent game-making.

## Super Smash Bros. (Series)

### Super Smash Bros.

I remember having no idea what this was when it came out. There was a corny ad where people in Nintendo character mascot suits beat each other up. Little did I know that this would go on to be one of the most legendary gaming ads of all time, or that it was a pretty literal advertisement for the game. Ads in the 90s were generally weird enough that you couldn’t really glean much from their content.* Even though it would go on to spawn a massive series, the original Smash was more a weird experiment. 

From the start, they hit on some good fundamentals that would ensure the series’ success. I’ve never been a big fighting game fan, but the Smash control scheme was so much more accessible than the weirdo combos and special moves of your traditional fighting games. Instead of depleting HP in a simple 2D arena, you knocked each other around (and eventually out) in varying arenas with all kinds of sloped terrain, platforms and hazards. And of course there’s a roster of pre-existing characters, some iconic and some not-so iconic, but definitely enough that Nintendo fans love, even in the first game’s quaint count of 12.
Most of the formula was there from the start, but Smash 64 is missing one big thing from its successors: polish. It’s hard to believe after seeing how detailed the series would become, but the first game is pretty janky. Many of the character models, like Mario, DK and Link, look worse than in previous N64 games they already appeared in. A lot of items and effects are 2D sprites. And overall, it feels pretty floaty and slow. But it’s still a lot of fun, and still the Smash game that I’m personally the most skilled at, which means I win at it more, and winning makes me feel better about myself.

*I watched the ad now and the game is explained both in the narration and gameplay footage, but an eight year old doesn’t notice those things!

### Super Smash Bros. Melee

I would consider the first Super Smash Bros a surprise hit, so it was expected for Melee to be _good_, but it surprised again by being a complete masterpiece. The experimental dents from the first game were completely worked away, turning this series into a highly polished love letter to Nintendo. Though model viewers have become more common in games now, I remember staring at the trophies in awe at some of the details they managed to include (of course not realizing at the time that many were likely lifted from the models where they are actually used in gameplay). Aside from the new sheen, this is really just a massive expansion of the original game: more fighters, more stages, more music tracks, etc. The trend of weird character choices continued, but it’s hard to deny that it’s fun when an oddball selection, such as Mr. Game & Watch, hits the mark.

The competitive nuances of Smash never really concerned a middling player such as me, but there was something that really felt good about Melee. Of course, many of my feelings around Smash games depend on what age I was when they came out, and in Melee’s case I got plenty of multiplayer time in. For what it’s worth, even though it isn’t exactly the main draw of Smash, I think Melee was the pinnacle of Smash single player. Boasting 25 characters, it was just the right amount to make modes like break the targets and all-stars feasible. I loved all of the new content added compared to the first game, like the event matches, multi-man melee and of course home run contest. Then there’s the aforementioned trophies that are just fun to look at. All of that stuff would be enough for a great game on its own, but as all Smash goes, if you grab the right group of friends you’ll never run out of fun things to do in it.

### Super Smash Bros. Brawl

Super Smash Bros. Brawl came out the same year that I began college, so you can bet that every single Wii owner at school had this. I didn't have my own Wii yet, but nonetheless got ample chances to play this. What more can really be said about Smash? It's Smash! At this point, the downside to the franchise was that the sheer number of characters got daunting. I gave up on trying to master more than a few, if I even mastered _any_ of them. The important thing is, even if you aren't good at the game, it's really fun to play over and over with a group.

### Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

I'm going to get real here for a second: Since around the mid 20th century, in many ways, each successive generation has had it harder than the one before. Smash Ultimate is one of those rare instances where I envied kids who were in high school and college when it came out, imagining all the parties and dorm room sessions that this game must have brought. It's a shame that the most awesome Smash is my least-played to appear on this list. Even though it came out beyond my Smash prime, it's hard to leave it off. They got Castlevania. Banjo-Kazooie finally made it! There's even Sephiroth, and so on. 

SSBU is perhaps the single greatest celebration of gaming. The expected Smash polish is here, but the sheer amount of content is unbeatable. The ability to disable hazards or put any stage in Battlefield or Omega form is such a simple yet brilliant concept that adds so much value to the game. Now I don't have to be disappointed if my favorite games got an annoying stage, since I can just change its form, and if you like playing basic stages now you get to mix up the aesthetic more. I never got fully into all its single-player content, but it seems like there was an effort to add a lot here. 

Prior Smash games do have their charms and nuances that are occasionally worth going back to, but Ultimate is the closest thing I could imagine to being a definitive edition. About the only bad thing I could say (besides the low-hanging fruit that is the online play) is that, like with Mario Kart 8, they've reached such heights that it's hard to imagine where the series can even go from here.
