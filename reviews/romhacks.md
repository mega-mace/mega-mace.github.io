# ROMhacks

This is a list of all ROMhacks I've played over time. For now, they will be listed alphabetically by their base game, until I feel like the page has gotten too big.

## Banjo-Kazooie

### The Jiggies of Time
#### Played on Everdrive X7

As the name suggests, Jiggies of Time is an Ocarina of Time-themed hack. Pretty much all the iconic locations are here, with some limitations (generally you only get a small bit of dungeons), but also plenty of creative liberties taken to add unique things instead. That makes sense, as OoT is not a platforming game, so it needed some molding to feel more like a Banjo-Kazooie game. And JoT is at its best when it sticks to the formula of being BK in a different world.

Make no mistake, this is a very high quality hack and a great consolation for anyone missing a newer real BK game, but it certainly doesn't always hit the mark. Some of the platforming is overly difficult, with weirdly small landing spaces (with equally small shock jump pads) being a fairly common occurrence. The egg shooting can get pretty dicey. Certain cues can be easy to miss. It's definitely a somewhat puzzle-y game, so I'm not sure what was deliberately obtuse or not, but in any case it often took more time than I'd have liked to find the next place to go.

Then there are the things that stretch the mechanics of BK so much that they don't really feel like BK and I'm not sure how I feel about all of that. An example of this is some sequences that use a camera to make it play 2D, but there are countless others. Sometimes it's interesting, but sometimes the sections can be so annoying I'd rather have a more "traditional" objective; either way, it feels like cheating a bit. One thing I think this hack did nail pretty well was write the characters how they would sound in an official game, although the amount of fourth-wall break dialogue was tedious.

This played pretty well on an Everdrive, although there are some downsides. There are some lesser bugs like particles (i.e. fire, footstep dust) not always appearing correctly. A number of areas experienced considerable slowdown. I think this was meant more to be played in emulators, as the creator's own guide is done that way. But the most annoying thing for me - which is forgivable if due to technical limitations - is that you have to recollect notes. With as confusing (and therefore long) as some of the levels could get, not having a save state option was less than ideal, but I still managed to be engaged enough to play through all of this.

## Super Mario Bros. 3

### 2nd Run
#### Everdrive N8 Pro

2nd Run is something of a "level pack" hack - a straightforward set of levels without a central theme or gimmick. The world maps are roughly the same size and themes as the base game, but in new arrangements. I couldn't really tell what the creator was going for since the levels are pretty inconsistent. Sometimes they feel like a "remix" of the corresponding base game level, but sometimes they're something totally different, or resemble a level from a different part of the game. Most of the levels are fine to actually get through, if not easier than the base game, but underwhelming. There are some "open" levels with misused verticality. Powerups and blocks are often placed without a lot of cohesion or purpose. Although this doesn't matter, the way level numbers don't always play out in order nags at my perfectionism. 

2nd Run gets most interesting near the later worlds, but moreso in terms of palettes and tiles than any gameplay changes. It also starts to feel unfinished by World 7, where I ran into a warp pipe bug, a level I'm not sure was even beatable, and a level I'm not sure was reachable. Finally, it completely runs out of steam with the unchanged 8th world.

### Classic
#### Everdrive N8 Pro

This is a remake of the first SMB game in SMB3's engine, something that's better as an idea to learn hacking with than an actual game. Due to the engine differences, I'm not sure this would've worked well either way, but it could've been better than it is. The choice of tilesets and palettes used is questionable, as there's no attempt to recreate the look of the source levels. Some of the levels are also incorrectly proportioned, but I'm not sure if it's due to different base tile sizes between the two games. It's not faithful enough to the original but doesn't remix levels in an interesting way either, leaving it in an inconsistent, unhappy medium. There are some SMB3 elements in here like mushroom houses and hammer bros, but inventory items make the game rather easy. It also felt a bit lazy to me that the world map themes are the same as base SMB3, but again, maybe this was made as a learning experience.

### Extended Edition
#### Everdrive N8 Pro

The Extended Edition is mostly the base game with attempts to reintroduce some cut features like the Japanese damage system and some beta levels. The damage changes make for a nice bit of extra challenge for veteran players, but the alleged beta levels are weird. I'm not sure if they were pieced together with incomplete information or were simply never completed by Nintendo, but they definitely feel strangely designed and out of place. For example, there are enemies and themes that don't seem like they belong in the given world, and sometimes harsh transitions to the level end goal. It was also kind of a slog to play through to see these levels since I had recently played the base game. They are interspersed through the normal game, but a standalone "beta world" hack might be a nice thing if one doesn't already exist.

### Mystery of the Flying Fish
#### Everdrive N8 Pro

The aptly-title Flying Fish hack is a single-world hack that's all about Cheep Cheeps. Whether they move straight, dart back and forth, or jump around, you name it, they're in it. Of course the big one is here and even the unused ones that move in a wave. This is a really well-done hack that makes challenges out of the different ways of avoiding them without overstaying its welcome. It's intuitive but still a solid test of skill. My only complaint is that game overs can be pretty punishing, especially since all the levels are auto-scrollers. I know that most of the levels have a (sometimes hard to reach) 1-up, but I eventually opted to save scum with this one.

### Super Mario All-Stars NES
#### Everdrive N8 Pro

I can't think of a more pointless and perhaps also more impressive hack at the same time. As the title suggests, it's like the SNES game, containing SMB 1, both 2s and 3, and even a save feature. Of course, the high chance of someone playing this on an emulator means that saving and quickly switching games are already not an issue. Likewise, flash carts like the Everdrive also solve those problems. But a big part of ROMhacking is challenging yourself with the technical work, so I have a lot of respect for the creator doing this seemingly just for the technical feat.

## Super Mario 64

Many of the hacks I've attempted for SM64 I have unfortunately had a hard time getting to run.

### Star Road
#### Everdrive X7

Seems like a decent hack, but has a poor framerate for me, even trying a supposedly Everdrive-optimized version. I didn't play much but noticed in one of the levels I had a hard time jumping out of water, otherwise the bugs I saw were just visual. The music seems to be songs from other games in the SM64 soundfont - a nice nostalgic approach when you recognize one, although I do also like to see games with original music. The best thing about it (though I assume not unique to this hack) is the reworked, more modern-style camera control.

### Super Mario 74
#### Everdrive X7

Decent performance, but a little glitchy with some things like jumping into the level entrance. I found struggles with the camera a lot and the game tries to tell you which camera to use, but it's still tough. Mostly I didn't get very far because I could tell it was going to be very platform heavy, i.e. wall jumps required in one of the very first objectives. The low quality dialogue also didn't leave a good impression.

### Kirby Edition
### Twisted Adventure
#### Everdrive X7

Crashed after pressing start on the tile screen.

### Mario's Nightmare
### Star Revenge
### The Green Stars
#### Everdrive X7

Crash immediately on trying to load up.

### Last Impact
### The Missing Stars
#### Everdrive X7

I already deleted these prior to the others that didn't work, so I assume one of the same two types of crashes.

## The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

### The Missing Link
#### Played on Everdrive X7

Depicting an imagining of the events between Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, The Missing Link is a great option for those looking to play a shorter OoT hack, coming in around 2 or 3 hours for me to beat it with a decent amount of heart pieces found. Fundamentally, the best things about this hack are that it's more OoT in a small dose, with a great soundtrack featuring original songs. Most of the areas are all new (aside from Kokiri Forest, which was redesigned for some reason), but they do a good job of feeling familiar yet fresh at the same time.

I do agree with another review I've seen that said the story isn't that cohesive, and sometimes the dialogue has some weak parts, but it's not that big of a deal to me. The gameplay is a little uneven, as sometimes TML seems like it's trying to be pretty faithful to the original, but it also introduces some new things. I like the new elements conceptually but at times they feel a bit bigger than the engine was meant to handle. For example, early in the game you get a sword beam, which works fine, but it has you sometimes attack enemies that are above at least the visual beam (it still hits). The item obtained in its singular dungeon, which I won't spoil, is a little awkward to get the hang of. There's also a part where you have to carry a Cucco through loading zones, causing it to respawn on the ground with each transition. I guess I can't complain about these things too much because I didn't face any major issues with it, but it feels like they could cause bugs.

In terms of more "normal" gameplay, in some ways TML is more forgiving than the original (no hearts lost in pits, very easy to get rupees), but sometimes lining up a bombchu or a long jump is annoying in this. It's definitely not anything a seasoned OoT player couldn't handle, but the inconsistency is a mild disappointment. The overworld can be a bit tedious to get through just because of how areas are sequenced together, as can the dungeon, but the dungeon is overall mostly pretty good and has some solid puzzles. The hardest part of the game for me was the ending boss, which again pushes the engine a little bit, but it was cool to see that it was pretty original in execution.

This was the first hack of anything I ever played, so I don't know fully what to expect, but I know nothing will be perfect. In spite of the flaws this definitely set a high bar. If you're looking for a more hardcore hack then this isn't the one, but if you want something that's generally not hard but still engaging, you can't go wrong with this.
