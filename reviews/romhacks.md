# ROMhacks

This is a list of all ROMhacks I've played over time. For now, they will be listed alphabetically by their base game, until I feel like the page has gotten too big.

## Banjo-Kazooie

### The Jiggies of Time
#### Played on Everdrive X7

As the name suggests, Jiggies of Time is an Ocarina of Time-themed hack. Pretty much all the iconic locations are here, with some limitations (generally you only get a small bit of dungeons), but also plenty of creative liberties taken to add unique things instead. That makes sense, as OoT is not a platforming game, so it needed some molding to feel more like a Banjo-Kazooie game. And JoT is at its best when it sticks to the formula of being BK in a different world.

Make no mistake, this is a very high quality hack and a great consolation for anyone missing a newer real BK game, but it certainly doesn't always hit the mark. Some of the platforming is overly difficult, with weirdly small landing spaces (with equally small shock jump pads) being a fairly common occurrence. The egg shooting can get pretty dicey. Certain cues can be easy to miss. It's definitely a somewhat puzzle-y game, so I'm not sure what was deliberately obtuse or not, but in any case it often took more time than I'd have liked to find the next place to go.

Then there are the things that stretch the mechanics of BK so much that they don't really feel like BK and I'm not sure how I feel about all of that. An example of this is some sequences that use a camera to make it play 2D, but there are countless others. Sometimes it's interesting, but sometimes the sections can be so annoying I'd rather have a more "traditional" objective; either way, it feels like cheating a bit. One thing I think this hack did nail pretty well was write the characters how they would sound in an official game, although the amount of fourth-wall break dialogue was tedious.

This played pretty well on an Everdrive, although there are some downsides. There are some lesser bugs like particles (i.e. fire, footstep dust) not always appearing correctly. A number of areas experienced considerable slowdown. I think this was meant more to be played in emulators, as the creator's own guide is done that way. But the most annoying thing for me - which is forgivable if due to technical limitations - is that you have to recollect notes. With as confusing (and therefore long) as some of the levels could get, not having a save state option was less than ideal, but I still managed to be engaged enough to play through all of this.

## The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

### The Missing Link
#### Played on Everdrive X7

Depicting an imagining of the events between Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, The Missing Link is a great option for those looking to play a shorter OoT hack, coming in around 2 or 3 hours for me to beat it with a decent amount of heart pieces found. Fundamentally, the best things about this hack are that it's more OoT in a small dose, with a great soundtrack featuring original songs. Most of the areas are all new (aside from Kokiri Forest, which was redesigned for some reason), but they do a good job of feeling familiar yet fresh at the same time.

I do agree with another review I've seen that said the story isn't that cohesive, and sometimes the dialogue has some weak parts, but it's not that big of a deal to me. The gameplay is a little uneven, as sometimes TML seems like it's trying to be pretty faithful to the original, but it also introduces some new things. I like the new elements conceptually but at times they feel a bit bigger than the engine was meant to handle. For example, early in the game you get a sword beam, which works fine, but it has you sometimes attack enemies that are above at least the visual beam (it still hits). The item obtained in its singular dungeon, which I won't spoil, is a little awkward to get the hang of. There's also a part where you have to carry a Cucco through loading zones, causing it to respawn on the ground with each transition. I guess I can't complain about these things too much because I didn't face any major issues with it, but it feels like they could cause bugs.

In terms of more "normal" gameplay, in some ways TML is more forgiving than the original (no hearts lost in pits, very easy to get rupees), but sometimes lining up a bombchu or a long jump is annoying in this. It's definitely not anything a seasoned OoT player couldn't handle, but the inconsistency is a mild disappointment. The overworld can be a bit tedious to get through just because of how areas are sequenced together, as can the dungeon, but the dungeon is overall mostly pretty good and has some solid puzzles. The hardest part of the game for me was the ending boss, which again pushes the engine a little bit, but it was cool to see that it was pretty original in execution.

This was the first hack of anything I ever played, so I don't know fully what to expect, but I know nothing will be perfect. In spite of the flaws this definitely set a high bar. If you're looking for a more hardcore hack then this isn't the one, but if you want something that's generally not hard but still engaging, you can't go wrong with this.
