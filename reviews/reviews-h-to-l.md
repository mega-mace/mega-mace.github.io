## Hades

Recent years have been a bit of a renaissance for the roguelike genre, but I always had a hard time getting into it. Granted, Hades is a rogue*lite*, but it helped me see the potential in short, randomized runs. Hades of course did not invent any of this, but it’s executed to perfection, avoiding a lot of the trappings of other games I’ve attempted in the genre. You collect various perks along the way, but instead of a guessing game of hundreds of items, they’re intuitive and give you small bonuses that can be stacked in interesting ways. Each of the main weapons are fun to use in their own way, imbuing a huge sense of variety to each run, with new challenges unfolding all the time.

Aside from the bite-sized appeal of playing a run or two at a time, the biggest strength of Hades is in the story. I re-learned so much about Greek mythology playing this, but it felt fresh with Supergiant’s detailed take on it. I was impressed at how seamlessly they put in so many dialogue paths, and even after playing a substantial amount I undoubtedly wasn’t even close to seeing it all. Despite a lack of big-money actors, the voices are used to great effect. It only took me a few lines of dialogue to get a sense of a character’s personality out of their tone and cadence—this of course is just describing what good voice acting is, but many games with a higher budget struggle to achieve it. No character, no matter how minor the role, feels like your typical irrelevant NPC thanks to this. Though I experienced my share of abortive runs, playing Hades never really felt like a waste of time due to the engaging combat, the drive to uncover more of the story, and even just the small moments of dialogue.

## Half-Life

Half-Life was one of those games that was maybe not a bucket list item per se, but certainly a big blind spot for a while, especially since I played 2 first. The gameplay of number 1 wasn't a big surprise then, but it's very impressive given the context of its time. Back when FPS games were still called "Doom clones", HL ushered in a new era. In a few ways the leap from Wolfenstein and Doom to HL feels bigger than the leap from HL to FPS of today. HL has a degree of immersiveness that makes it feel downright modern, with its continuously unfolding levels, and impressive enemy AI that can do things like take cover behind objects and attempt to flush _you_ out of cover with grenades.

But many elements of HL are also a throwback. Even though the guns are animated in greater detail than a game like Doom, they don't have a lot of recoil or reactivity like in future FPS games, and combined with the generous auto-aim there is still some of that more "arcadey" feel to shooting. There is also a lot of platforming you don't really see much anymore, although at times it's the game's biggest flaw. I found the movement to be a little bit too fast (initially I tried to play this with a controller, but it's completely unplayable, and even still fast with a keyboard), considering the many instances you need to jump or walk along narrow ledge. 

HL also has a light amount of puzzle solving oriented around simple physics (box pushing) and activating switches across a series of locations. It was a nice throwback, but I am glad they got rid of the blue/yellow/red keycard trope. What really feels old about it is that you can get stuck at times and the game won't help you along, but it never took me too long to figure out the way forward, which is refreshing in contrast to today's hand-holding games. The last thing I should mention is that you can occasionally recruit security officers to help you out, which is a little but underwhelming, but another show of Valve's ambition to change the genre. If you can get over the sometimes overly sensitive movement and mildly confusing objectives, HL still holds up today - and even if you can't, it deserves respect as a forefather to the modern FPS.

## Half-Life 2

Half-Life 2 is largely a continuation of the great concepts from the first entry, but in a significantly larger scope. As I write this it's been quite a while since I've played it, but I recall it takes you through different cities, caves and underground installations, in contrast to the first game being mainly around the vicinity of the (admittedly quite large) Black Mesa facility. Of course, the introduction of Alyx Vance adds some welcome detail to the story, as well as some prodding on where to go. I do recall I still would get slightly stuck sometimes, but that would probably be refreshing to me if I replayed it now.

Of course, a huge addition to HL2 is its legendary gravity gun. The concept is so simple in hindsight, and has been adopted in various other games: pick up an object from a distance, and fling it away from you with force. It's such a natural fit for an FPS, giving you the ability to fling saw blades or launch explosive barrels at your foes. I still ended up using the regular guns more, but it was always fun to play around with.

After this (including the expansion episodes of course), the franchise as a whole sadly proved to be a dinosaur, not because it's outdated per se, but because of years without a conclusion. Eventually we got an unexpected VR revival that is unfortunately too cost-prohibitive for the average person, and I'll probably never play either, but maybe now there's a faint hope we get some kind of traditionally-controlled follow-up?

## Halo: Combat Evolved

I don’t remember exactly how Halo and Xbox came onto my radar. Obviously it goes without saying that this is the game that made Xbox, but the console was still an unknown newcomer (albeit with a huge brand backing it). I do remember that we got an Xbox for Christmas because there was a decent priced (non-Halo) bundle. At whatever point we ended up getting Halo, it was pretty clear why it was the king of Xbox. PC LAN pioneers will probably scoff at my naivete, but this was where I was introduced to system link. Playing with more than four people was amazing! So was having less split screen (especially back when a 32 inch TV was considered big). Having released before Xbox Live launched, this was initially the proper way to get the Halo multiplayer experience. It probably still is, though I can’t act like the slow death of local multiplayer has only affected Halo.

The single player wasn’t as big of a draw to me, but still had plenty of memorable moments. Coming off Perfect Dark as my heavily played FPS, the generational jump to Halo was a wonder to behold. The scope of some of the levels felt so enormous (thanks to some loading tricks) and performance was slick. Halo marked a big turning point in FPS design, with the two-weapon system and regeneration based health. While those elements don’t always get put to good use in games, I never really had a problem with them in Halo. The scale of conflict and involvement of multiple factions also added to the mystique of this new universe. Piloting vehicles for combat was a new concept to me, and one that games struggle to this day to do as well as Halo. Even the Halo series itself now struggles with what direction it wants to take, but not until after propping up Xbox in the early days.

## Halo 2

While working on this list I was kind of stunned to work out the conclusion that I _probably_ got my Xbox for Christmas in 2003. By today's standards, the three-year gap between Halo 1 and 2 is nothing, so it's especially funny to me to realize that I had been playing Halo for less than a year, yet Halo 2 felt like the ultimate Game That Can Not Come Out Soon Enough.

My Halo 2 story is one of a bygone era. Even though it considerably predates the digital distribution age, Halo 2 feels like perhaps the last true huge gaming release event. I remember seeing multi-page features in the newspaper surrounding the hype for the game. They talked about all the celebrity voice cameos. Coverage of people waiting in lines was all over mainstream news channels, the stuff usually reserved for _console_ launches. It felt like were in a new era, a widespread celebration of gaming, and industry legitimacy.

Halo 2 was really a lot of the same, but that isn't such a bad thing with a great formula to base it on, and I definitely took notice of the additions at the time. I'm not sure if the campaign was _better_ than CE or not, but it was so mind-blowing at the time to have them take it to Earth. The duel-wielding felt like a modern take on a classic FPS element. Most of all, there were just numerous new weapons, gameplay changes and maps that ensured this was a multiplayer staple for a long time. It pretty much replaced the original for me in that regard, feeling much better to play. And of course, with the addition of Xbox Live (thankfully with the LAN option intact), it was no doubt a huge factor in ushering in the era of console online play.

## Halo 3

I am a huge fan of the first two Halo games, but after replaying their campaigns in recent years I felt like some of the magic was gone. I've always wanted to play 3, which I didn't have the money for at the time when it made the jump to 360, but without the nostalgia boost it seemed even less exciting than the other two to finally (re)visit in the 2020s. Now to be clear, those two _are_ still great games, but it turns out sometimes fresh experiences are better than revisited ones.

It helps that Halo 3 is a fresher game than its predecessor in general, iterating much more over 2 than 2 did over 1. There's a noticeable increase in the number of vehicle types, some new objectives like mid level scarab bosses, and subtle changes that keep you on your toes as you find familiar strategies don't always work anymore. The new grenade types and armor abilities are also a decent addition, even if I don't find them to be a revelation. I'm still not sure how I feel about the fight against Brutes instead of Elites, but at least the Brutes were revamped and given some more Elite-like qualities.

In contrast to 2 taking a dip later in the game, I feel like 3 takes a while to ramp up. The industrialized Earth settings of the early levels are a bit drab, but gradually it shows more of that combination of alien installations and nature settings I'm used to. I still think overall it is a bit thin on some of the level types that "feel like" Halo, but I also have to give it credit for not being as much of a retread in that regard. It's a minor complaint in any case. Otherwise, Halo 3 maintains the high standard of mixing small scale and large scale shooter gameplay I've come to expect. I found the squad gameplay to be a little more fleshed out, although you still can't directly give marines orders. It might also come at the expense of the solo levels, but there is a cool one late in the game that truly makes you feel the struggle of missing your allies. I don't have too much to say about the story, but one thing I love about Halo is that it feels epic without being tonally too serious. I mainly intended to play 3 just to cross one off the list that's subtly nagged at me for almost 20 years, but I should've known I was in for a genuinely awesome game.

## Halo 4

In contrast to me missing Halo 3 at its time, Halo 4 came out so late in the 360 lifecycle that I did get to experience more of it, with prices winding down and availability becoming easier. Even though 3 is definitely more popular, I have much stronger memories of playing 4 simply from playing it a lot more.

When it came out, I wasn't super in tune with the whole Bungie-343 situation, but was still aware of the consternation surrounding a new developer releasing their first totally new Halo game. There is little doubt that at this point we were past Halo's prime as one of the biggest names in gaming, but I like to think of Halo 4 as its last gasp of relevance. The hype levels didn't match 2 or 3, but I do recall it was somewhat of an event when it launched. 

At this point it seemed like nobody really cared about playing the campaign, and after breezing through it once I can say yeah, it was quite forgettable. Even with the Halo games that had better campaigns, it really was all about the multiplayer for me. Halo 4 made some Call of Duty-esque attempts at customizing loadouts with different weapons and perks that weren't my favorite changes, but with various game modes that got added back in over time it improved. Some weird design decisions/mismanagement aside, Halo still has really good core mechanics that are fun to play so long as people will actually play it, and in the case of 4 I remember years after launch still having a healthy player base to keep me going.

## Haunted Castle (Revisted)

See Castlevania (A to C) section

## Hi-Fi Rush

A quick Game Pass look I checked out on pure hype, it looked like something resembling Jet Set Radio (or at least my distant conception of JSR), which is out of my wheelhouse. It is evidently a bit more unique, a rhythm game combined with a sort of 3D beat em up, but the cartoony visuals and punky character attitudes still made it feel a bit like it was out of another time. I had a lot of the same feelings playing this as I did when trying out Cadence of Hyrule, which is that I prefer my rhythm games cut and dry, just hitting buttons in time with the prompt. That's a fancy way of saying, I suck at doing the rhythm when it's a little more implicit, not to mention mixed with other gameplay elements. HFR does advertise that it's not meant to be difficult if you miss on the beats, but without that, there doesn't seem much point to me.

## Jet Force Gemini

It’s somewhat hard to believe that in 1999, the third person shooter genre hardly existed, and certainly had no gold standard. JFG, to be clear, was not a gold standard, but it might have just been too ahead of its time! Well, except for its advertising campaign, which I remember coming in… a VHS tape in the mail. I believe Rare also did this for DKC, but this was the first and only time I can remember getting a video tape of a game. I’m not even sure why; could be a result of a gaming magazine subscriber list, but I don’t think we ever asked for it.

Granted, as I write about it now, it doesn’t feel that advanced, but games with space travel always seem more futuristic. The planet-hopping element was fun, even if it was just a glorified world map, as there are no playable travel sequences. More impressive was the character-hopping, which maybe isn’t the most novel idea, but still tends to get under-utilized in gaming to this day. Of course there is a downside to the repetition, but it was also a lot of fun getting to approach levels in a new way and use each character’s special abilities to unlock new parts. Unfortunately it was beholden to the bizarre N64 controller, but it played pretty well for what they were working with. Shooting strange looking guns at giant bugs is just fun. 

The cinematic soundtrack to the game is incredible, and it’s full of little side missions and easter eggs. The limited Floyd co-op was a neat idea. Most of all, it’s just a lot of fun to go to the varying planets. The game does get bogged down by Rare’s overzealous collecting they loved at that time, but luckily most of the places you visit throughout the journey are fun to come back to. This is a game I’ve always wished would get a proper remake or remaster, as it just needs a little tighter shooting mechanics. It could have been a classic, but I still love it personally, and it was another example of Rare’s constant ambition in the era.

## Kirby Super Star

I'm not the biggest fan of the Kirby series, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be Super Star. Though some of its boasted 8 games are very short, it still offers enough in the way of more substantial experiences. KSS is no exception to the series' famous lower difficulty, but it leans into some concepts that help make up for it. Compared to prior entries, it plays a bit more like a stylized beat-em-up than a pure platformer, and the flashy animations and variety of abilities give excitement that mask the simplicity. The addition of co-op was huge—I think part of the appeal of Kirby is you can bring more inexperienced gamers along for the ride, without them being dead weight like they might be in more challenging games.

So a lot of this could be said for future Kirby games as well, but I think KSS gets points for figuring out this formula first, and also maintaining more variety. Later entries would play it a bit safe, keeping some of these ideas, but falling into the traditional platforming mold a bit too much. The KSS modes aren’t super ambitious, but they play to the Kirby series’ strengths and weaknesses well: Great Cave Offensive puts emphasis on non-linear exploration; Revenge of Meta-Knight adds a bit of tension and excitement with a timer; and Milky Way Wishes gives a (slight) taste of being deprived of Kirby’s iconic copy ability. 

## Kirby and the Amazing Mirror

When I heard this was a Kirby Metroidvania I thought it would be a good use of the formula. I enjoyed The Great Cave Offensive for putting more emphasis on exploration, given Kirby's easy nature can be boring for straightforward linear platforming. Unfortunately Amazing Mirror disappoints as only a loose adherent to the genre. Backtracking is expected, but in this you constantly have to re-enter the same doors from the hub world and repeat parts of the level from the starting point. A lot of places I could go seemed to have no real purpose in progression, and then they kick you back to the hub world where you have to start from a door again. Instead of having permanent upgrades, you need to carry through certain copy abilities to pass some obstacles, though I didn't play long enough to see if said obstacles were mandatory. What sounded like one of the most interesting Kirby games on paper sadly turned out to be one of the most tedious to play of all.

## Kuru Kuru Kururin

This game, whose name I do not enjoy writing, but also has an unfortunate initialism, is a puzzle maze game where you navigate a (slowly-spinning) helicopter from a top down perspective. The core idea is that you can only pass certain areas while your blades are at a certain angle. I thought it was pretty novel, and fairly addicting at first, but quickly grew bored of the harder stages as it felt like it was more about control precision than puzzle solving.

## The Last Guardian

I went into The Last Guardian without the highest of expectations, but nevertheless interested in one of the few Japanese-developed games in the modern Sony catalog. In one sense, it delivered on the promise there, with an artful world and epic yet intimate tale. But it's hard for a game to be great on that alone, and TLG doesn't have a whole lot else going for it.

The long development cycle on this shows, as it's dated in many areas. The control is subpar across the board: climbing on or off things can be difficult, mirror aiming can't be inverted, and of course there's getting Trico to obey commands. But even fundamentals like moving feel slippery, jumps are easily missed and the camera finds itself in strange places. The graphics are often saved by the look of distant vistas, but otherwise are very unremarkable for PS4 standards.

A big portion of the game is climbing around as the boy, which felt surprisingly Western-influenced, though I actually found the climbing scenarios more interesting than many contemporaries, controls aside. They are interesting because paths are not overly obvious, but that ambiguity hurts the game in a lot of other places, where another good chunk is spent on jumping around on Trico's back. It's often unclear where you can jump, and there is a lot of waiting around for Trico to get lined up - perhaps an intentional attempt to convey the difficulty of working with an animal, but it gets old fast.

Almost all the rest of the game is combat and puzzles. I will say the combat is better than it sounds on paper, but it is ultimately just a lot of waiting on Trico to do his thing. The puzzles, unfortunately, are where the game might falter the most. They have a tendency to either be too obvious or too esoteric to be satisfying. Except near the very end, it feels like there is very little building on previous techniques. There are a lot of arbitrary puzzles introduced with a lack of any prior context. 

I found myself reaching for a guide often in this one, even tempted at times to watch a playthrough, which I've never done as a way to complete a game outside of some too tough final boss fights. I'm glad I stuck it through, but there is little variation to how you can approach the game, and not much fun in solving the puzzles on your own. The most impressive thing is probably the animations of mannerisms for Trico, but they might have spent a little _too_ much effort here and not on the rest of the game. I left satisfied with the story, but unsure it was worth everything else involved.

## The Last of Us

Naughty Dog found their niche with the Uncharted games, in the story-driven third-person linear action genre. Where Uncharted is fundamentally about high-stakes action thrills, I went into TLOU expecting a grittier and sadder version of it. It's a story of loss and desperation, which does take many sad turns, but not always in the ways I was expecting. Joel and Ellie are victims of violence and paranoia, but also perpetrators of it. Of course, it's far from morally black and white, raising age-old moral questions about what extent it's okay to go to be willing to survive, or if human lives are worth expending for the greater good.

I tend to be underwhelmed by games that ask you to make moral choices, so I'm not sure they would be right here, but for all of the asking those big questions that TLOU does, it doesn't actually give you any influence over them. The choices you do get are your approach to combat - whether to be stealthy, what to craft and upgrade, etc. It's a bit of a step up from Uncharted in that regard, but there are certainly more interesting games out there from a gameplay standpoint. The real reason to play TLOU is the hauntingly beautiful atmosphere of overgrown apocalypse, but more importantly - and expectedly at this point - the top-notch dialogue and characters. It clearly does certain things well, but the modern Naughty Dog catalog isn't exactly what I'm looking for out of a game. 

## Limbo

I didn't even love Inside when I played it years ago, but this was a short game available when I had Game Pass, so why not give it a shot? It's easy to see how this is like a proto-Inside, but that greater simplicity might not be a bad thing. Limbo is very compact, and the puzzles generally short on frustration (even if they are also pretty short on novelty). The later game did have some fun moments for me, when it becomes a little bit more platformer-y and less puzzle-y. The minimalist black and white art is an effective and unique aesthetic. While I can't see much reason to revisit this one, it was a solid example of how indie games can challenge the medium.
