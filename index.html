            <p>Here I have collected reviews and other info on games I've played over time. This started out with a top 100 games of all time list (accompanied with reviews), and then I started a "year in review" to collect new reviews of games as I play them. I've simplified things a bit and put all the reviews in place. This serves as sort of an incomplete catalog of every game I've ever played - incomplete since it started in only 2023, although the back catalog of reviews I had created from the top 100 provides a pretty decent picture of my overall gaming history. There also won't be a review for everything I play _at all_, but I try to include anything that I put a decent amount of time into.</p>

            <h2>Site Details</h2>
            <p>This site is very much a work in progress stylistically, but is functional and somewhat responsive. For now, it looks best on mobile and 1080p resolutions.</p>

            <h3>Known Bugs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refreshing on a top 100/year in review will stay at the current scroll height</li>
                <li>Sub-dropdowns on decades appear next to the button below instead of directly to the side</li>
                <li>Dropdowns have a general inconsistency on how they appear due to different sizes of parent</li>
            </ul>
