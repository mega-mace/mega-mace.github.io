            <p>This was originally a site for game reviews, and mostly still is, but I also have expanded it to movies, and perhaps other media at some point?</p>
            <p>Word of warning: I have a small number of reviews where spoilers are marked, but since your mileage may vary on what counts as a spoiler, tread lightly on a lot of them.</p>

                <p>I've gotten into emulating more, but due to the generally simpler nature of those games, most of them will be on separate pages:</p>
                <a href="others/roms.html" class="inline-link">ROMs</a>
                <br>
                <a href="others/romhacks.html" class="inline-link">ROMhacks</a>

                <br>
                <p>Lastly, here is my page for <a href="others/movies.html" class="inline-link">Movie Reviews</a></p>
            </p>

            <h2>Site Details</h2>
            <p>This site is very much a work in progress stylistically, but is functional and somewhat responsive. For now, it looks best on mobile and 1080p resolutions.</p>

            <h3>Known Bugs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refreshing on a top 100/year in review will stay at the current scroll height</li>
                <li>Sub-dropdowns on decades appear next to the button below instead of directly to the side</li>
                <li>Dropdowns have a generally inconsistency on how they appear due to different sizes of parent</li>
            </ul>
