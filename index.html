            <p>Word of warning: Spoilers are not currently marked in reviews. Most reviews shouldn't have any spoilers, but for some it was pretty unavoidable to talk about them without.</p>

            <h3>Known Bugs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refreshing on a top 100/year in review view will return you to the intro page</li>
                <li>Refreshing on a top 100/year in review will stay at the current scroll height</li>
                <li>Sub-dropdowns on decades appear next to the button below instead of directly to the side</li>
                <li>Dropdowns have a generally inconsistency on how they appear due to different sizes of parent</li>
            </ul>
