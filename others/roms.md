# ROM Roundup

This page is for tracking ROMs I've sampled. There is a big world of retro games out there, and I've already played most of the stuff that interests me... but what else is out there? This is for tracking all those, and perhaps ones that interest me enough will get a proper look in my years in review. But this file is just for writing quick impressions, and is not specific to any year I played them. They will be listed alphabeticaly per console.

## NES

## Game Boy

## SNES

## Game Boy Color

## Sega Master System

## Sega Genesis

## Sega Game Gear

I initially started writing out more on individual games for this system, but later realized a lot of them are ports of SMS games, and there's not much reason to play or write about those ones individually. They have a lot of the same problems, particularly platformers that use mostly the same level design but with a smaller screen that makes it harder to anticipate hazards. I also don't find the sound chip to be very good. It was a neat piece of tech for its time, but outside of true exclusives I'm not sure of a reason to play a lot of these in modern times when their superior versions are widely accessible.
