# ROM Roundup
This page is purely for listing ROMs I've sampled. It is more geared towards "random" games, as things I actually want to give a deeper look at will still show up in the year in review. Now of course, they aren't completely arbitrary picks. Some were from ROM packs labeled as "Top 100" (according to whom I have no idea), but after a while I started looking for more curated lists per platform, from sources such as IGN. I also started out writing little synopses of each, but even that started to be too much of a chore, and probably isn't that exciting to read, since they have many issues in common.

Some of these platforms are so old that in modern times, being an alleged "top 100", or sometimes even into the top 20, needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Some hold up still, but many have been long since seen better takes on whatever it was they tried to do. With handheld games in particular, so many are (effectively) limited ports of a home console game - certainly they had their place in car rides in the 90's, but with the bigger console equally easy to emulate now, it's hard to see much value in these reduced versions today.

I'm also listing out homebrews and ROMhacks here. My criteria for listing something is basically that I played it enough to know whether or not I'd want to continue it.

## ROMhacks

## Homebrew

I'm organizing these by source and platform - mostly for my own record keeping than anything else, so I know where I've already looked. Fundamentally I don't know if there is much difference in sources, although some sites like romhacking.net (RHDN) have significantly older homebrews. But based on my experience playing them... that's not necessarily a great thing.
