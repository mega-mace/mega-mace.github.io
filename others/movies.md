# Movies

Because I can't help but write down every thought, here is a list of movies I've watched as well. Film isn't really my forte, but I do occasionally watch them. I'm only going to review movies I watch or rewatch going forward, and probably with pretty short reviews. This was started in August 2024.

I've devised a "ratings" system to summarize each one with:
- **Avoid**: Self-explanatory, movies that there is no reason to watch, though I would be surprised if I will even watch any in this tier myself.
- **Bad Watchable**: For films that are not conventionally good, but have some kind of value, so bad it's good, etc.
- **Watchable**: Something that's average, inoffensive, acceptable for a casual viewing, and so on.
    - **+/-**: Within this tier specifically, because I think it will encompass most things, I might also add a plus or minus. As one might guess, a minus is tilted more towards a film being bad, a plus towards being good, and neither is neutral.
- **Recommended**: Hopefully self-explanatory. Something I'd generally recommend to people, maybe barring dislike for the genre or whatever.
- **Essential**: Something nearly anyone should watch.

## The Super Mario Bros. Movie
### Watchable (-)

The Mario movie is something that pleased a lot of fans by simply having reverance for the source material, but with how closely Nintendo was involved, that's kind of a given. There isn't much point to this film, as it's like a big commercial for Mario for people who already like Mario. Underneath the revered franchise it's a typical middling children's animated movie - celebrity casting, surface level plotting and jokes, cliches of all sorts. I hope that possible sequels at least have more going on with some of the "worldbuilding" out of the way. Movie #1 is so crammed with references, sometimes fun (I like the throwback to the bros being from Brooklyn), but sometimes pointless (Mario Kart feels like commercial appeal filler from their best-selling Mario games), that it leaves even less room for anything of substance.
