### Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga

I got through about half of this game until I ran up on the release of the next one on this list, and by the time I could've gone back to it, I decided there wasn't much need to continue. This is the kind of game I played more the sake of being able to say I played it, which is what I've been trying to do less of this year. I am a medium-sized fan of both Paper Mario and Super Mario RPG, so I thought it would be good to see what the third style of Mario RPG was like, and I did get a decent enough idea of it in the limited time.

It was interesting to learn that developer AlphaDream was formed in part with ex-Square developers, and it shows in ways that I don't know how to explain. At first I was basking in the Square/SNES-like nostalgia, but it wasn't enough to carry a game that can get boring. I'm not sure if it really does anything worse than the other light-hearted Mario RPG games, but my tolerance for them might be lower now. M&L leans even more into the timed action concept than its counterparts, which I would've figured is a logical to place to take them, but I'm not so sure after playing it. The badges felt even more simple, and the timed actions make (almost?) any battle possible to do without taking damage. That's not to say getting a perfect battle is easy, as the most challenging and interesting thing about the game is the simultanoues character control, but overall it's clearly meant to be a lighter game. The first Paper Mario's battle system already felt more untraditional in comparison to SMRPG, but M&L takes it even further. And with a silly but low-stakes story, as to be expected, this one is another game that's perfectly fine but not essential.

### Final Fantasy VII Rebirth

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that I had pretty clear expectations for, in that it would probably have the things I liked about FF7 Remake but also some things that I disliked. And my expectations were pretty much correct, so a lot of my sentiment towards Rebirth can be summed up with my Remake review (Top 100 Games for 2020). But just because it had a lot of those same things in place doesn't mean there wasn't a lot added.

Early on, I almost rolled my eyes seeing yellow paint climb holds, tower-climbing, quest-filled open maps and item crafting, gameplay elements that were already outdated in the 2020 predecessor that managed to avoid them. But perhaps "outdated" is a bit unfair - they are a bit cliche in AAA, but serve their purpose. Rebirth doesn't break the mold as an open world game, and arguably isn't even _that_ open world with the way it's sectioned off, but that can also strengthen it by making the sometimes checklist-y quest items managed by region. I did enjoy exploring on Chocobo even if it's just another take on a horse, but they gave them a few special abilities that were nice. 

Just like Remake, it does lean heavily on the strength of the source material, but it does avoid the very possible trap of screwing it up. There are certain times maybe it can lack in subtlety compared to the original, plus some confusing stuff, but it makes up for it with mostly good added and expanded material. 

Rebirth isn't all that revolutionary in general, but it might be a potential all-timer just for all the things it throws at you. A lot of big budget games lately either find the one thing they're good at and stick with it, or they're open world games that repeat various shallow content all over. Rebirth obviously is closer to the latter, but it's far from the worst example of tedious open world tasks, as the story payoff can often be good worldbuilding, and a lot of it is close enough to the main path. But aside from the usual open world elements, Rebirth has a lot more, and it feels like a throwback with all the minigames honoring the original's legacy. With one exception (Queen's Blood, and _maybe_ Chocobo racing), the minigames are all fun but not great, the kind of thing you'd play just for the main game objectives but not get wrapped up in otherwise. Yet I'm not sure I'd have it any other way, as it makes them just minor distractions in the game that don't demand too much of your time when you see one, though collectively add up in the experience.

Rebirth is full of silly elements aside from the minigames, and that's the charm of it. It knows when to be serious, and the themes are ever resonant. But it's not the kind of game that is so self-serious it is afraid to have too much fun at its own expense. Sometimes Rebirth moments can be a little corny, campy or gratuitous, but only within the context of themselves; they don't spoil any of the bigger picture, and it's hard to even imagine it at all without them.

### New Super Luigi U

After playing Super Mario Bros. Wonder last year, I wanted to go back to New Super Mario Bros. and see if I was being unfair with it. This is my compromise on doing so, as I never played the Luigi levels, so it let me experience something a little new too. And to be fair, there are some pretty creative levels, but it takes a few worlds to get going. SMBW would hit you with unique things right off the bat, but NSLU does a lot of easing into the familiar world of Mario with lots of early levels that feel "tile designed" in their simplicity. And even once the more creative levels hit, they just aren't as common or as memorable as SMBW.

A gripe I have with NSLU in particular is that, although the levels are shortened to 100 seconds, most of them do feel like scaled down regular Mario levels. They aren't as expansive, but they still have you exploring and stopping to think about star coins to some degree. The time limit is more there to make you _feel_ rushed than an actual challenge to overcome. Given the short time limit I would've liked to see more levels that focus on speed and timing jumps to keep your momementum, but there were very few. Additionally, Luigi's unique mechanics are rarely, if ever, tested outside of optional objectives in a level; I would've liked to see some sections where you realize you have to make an extra high or long jump to proceed. 

The short pace of the levels also means you don't get a lot of time to really master their gimmicks, or remember them for long after. The base NSMBU is likely a little better, though also largely forgettable. These are the kind of games I don't mind having played once, but I'd rather just replay Super Mario 3 or World if I'm in the mood for 2D Mario. And now, for a modern take, SMBW gives us a much better looking and diverse take on it. There are very faint glimpses of that in NSLU, but it's mostly an okay additional set of challenges for NSMBU that is afraid to fully break free from its base game's conventions.

### Titanfall 2

Titanfall 2 isn't the most popular game around, but one that I've only ever heard really good things, and I can see why. I don't know if I'm quite ready to call it one of the best FPS campaigns of all time, but the question did go through my mind as I was playing it. Granted, FPS campaigns are not one of my strongest suits anyway, but regardless, TF2 was a remarkably fun game to play. 

Obviously a key part of it is the mechanics, and undoubetdly zipping around on walls and doing double jumps is a ton of fun, especially for a genre that can be awkward for platforming. Getting into the mech is also of course a highlight, but at its core TF2 also has some snappy and satisfying control for the ordinary shooting sections. TF2's story feels almost more like a little vignette, but what it excels at is being interesting without getting in the game's way. 

In general, TF2 isn't bogged down with much. I was impressed to play something that is so "all killer, no filler", but it does it in a breezy five or six hours. At such a small amount of time, it definitely started fading from my mind pretty fast. It impresses, and does so without waste, but not for long. But it may be a game worth revisiting later at a higher difficulty level.

### Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin

After playing Dark Souls 2, it's not hard to see why it's considered a black sheep in the series. There is a lot of stuff that's still good here, but something about the experience just feels off. At the start I quickly noticed things that recalled a regression back to Demon's Souls: having a central area to level up, consumable healing items at the start, and losing some of your max health upon death. You eventually build up your flasks, and you don't lose _much_ health each time (and it's easier to restore), so it's not as annoying as Demon's, but it just doesn't make sense to go back to things that were happily absent in Dark Souls 1. The central leveling is a blessing and a curse, because you get bonfire fast travel very early, but you lose that sense of traversal and connectedness in the world.

I defeated the first boss of the game without taking damage, which is an appropriate tone-setter. I think I defeated more bosses in DS2 on my first blind run than I might have in all the other Soulslikes I've played combined. Is it an easier game than usual, or did I just stumble upon a broken build? Coming off Elden Ring as my last played, one thing that's for sure is the boss move sets are so much simpler, but that would probably be the case if I were to go back to DS1 as well. I definitely think something is off here though. For instance, there's a lack of "miniboss" enemies. Instead DS2 tends to opt for trying to take you down with gangs of small enemies, which is more annoying and less fun than outduelling a single powerful one.

There are some interesting experimental touches to DS2. In particular, the petrified journeyers and the Pharros contraptions show interesting potential, but they are undermined by being tied to rare consumable items. The more boring but fleshed-out mechanic is the torch, which is a much simpler management of resources since it can be a loot drop. One of the highlights of DS2 for me was a boss where you can light the arena ahead of time to give you an advantage. Most of the time the torch "puzzle" sections are an adequate little addition to the series, but I definitely sensed an over-reliance on it by the end.

Above all else, DS2 is just lacking in compelling areas to traverse through. I will say it is about on par with other entries in terms of how things are laid out to make you think about obtaining loot in the distance, exploring from a different angle, etc. The problem is that it doesn't linger on most of its areas long. DS1 had so many places I remember, sometimes from being stuck trying to get through, but memorable nonetheless. Everyone knowss Anor Londo, Sen's Fortress and Blighttown, and that's just a few. DS2 has maybe two or three areas of that scope TOTAL, but it's mostly a jump between small 1-2 bonfire-sized zones.

What does DS2 do right? Not get in its own way with regards to having the basics down. I'm pretty sure there are also a few, _little_ quality of life improvements over DS1. But in the bigger picture, like the enemies, bosses and levels, it's hard not to say it's a downgrade across the board. It's a classic good game in a great series, the kind of thing you'd recommend if only it weren't attached to a name where there are plenty of better ones to choose from.

### Bucky O'Hare

 Bucky O'Hare is the game I got started learning to ROMhack with, so naturally I needed to play it. It's also a game that appears on my top 100, more as a sentimental favorite. I don't mean that like it isn't a good game, although after replaying it, I could definitely see even more flaws than before. To be fair, a lot of those flaws are in comparison to Mega Man, but I realized just how much better MM is beyond the more superificial reasons in my top 100 entry.

 I'd say that fundamentally BOH is just too easy, but I have read and watched people online say it's a hard game. I can get easily over 30 extra lives in this game... so okay, maybe experience plays a factor in that, but why even let me get that many in the first place? That's the main issue with BOH's difficulty, it's overly forgiving. I think when people say that it's hard they mean it has some tough platforming screens, and a good amount of those have instant deaths. But outside of that, it's almost laughable.

 The levels don't have intermittent checkpoints like MM, instead opting to let you retry on _every_ screen, even after one of its barely-punishing game overs. Enemy placement is pretty predictable and not overly cumbersome, but it's especially hindered by their general weakness. Outside of a minority of the bosses, I'd say nearly every enemy doesn't do enough damage or have enough HP. It's the kind of game where most of my deaths are in a pit or spikes, but having HP whittled down is very rare compared to MM.

 Another weird thing I noticed is that levels might have a sequence of three to four screens that use the same platforming gimmick, but their difficulties are all mixed up instead of steadily progressing. It's not the worst thing, but it does come across as sloppy. 

 One thing I'll give credit to BOH for over MM is that I switched between the different characters more than I tend to switch abilities in MM, but that's more because I think MM doesn't do a great job making most of them obviously appealing. Even in BOH, out of the five characters there are only two I get much use out of; one is mostly just for boss fights and the other two only have a handful of useful screens each. The character abilities are less creative than MM powers, but they are intuitive in their usefulness; switching between characters is very snappy, and there's no guesswork about enemy weaknesses or energy cost to experimenting. This is definitely the most interesting thing BOH had going for it, but I wish it was explored more.

## Mini Reviews

These are games I didn't really have a ton to say about, but still wanted to document for my year's playthroughs.

### Mario Kart 8 Booster Course DLC

With my NSO expiring, I checked out all the booster course races. Playing them was mostly a reminder of what a great game MK8 is and how good it feels to race (when some bad luck frustration doesn't happen). Overall the pack was pretty fun, but not up to par with the base game, with the reliance on real-world based Tour courses feeling a little out of place. It was interesting to see that many of the courses had changing routes each lap, perhaps foretelling a key design gimmick for MK9?

### Shovel Knight

I replayed this in anticipation of selling it, but I don't have much to add about it that wasn't already said in my Top 100 review. If you like the games it is derived from but don't want to experience the frustration anymore, it's a great choice. After playing it again (just the Shovel of Hope campaign), it really is hard to think of a big flaw. There basically aren't any screens of the game that I felt were unfair or excessive - maybe 3 or 4 that were borderline, but that's it.

### Super Mario Maker 1 & 2

SMM2 is one I had to play again for a bit before my NSO subscription went up. It's a shame that 1 already sapped a lot of my creative energy, because I liked checking out most of the few levels I did make, especially after they added Link to the game. SMM1 got revisited because I needed to hook up my Wii U, and it was a bit humbling going back to my own creations. It was always frustrating to pour hours into perfecting a level only to get bad numbers on it. But playing many of them years later, with almost fresh eyes that have forgotten both the tricks of the level and the pain of making it, it was easier to see that some I made just weren't very good.
