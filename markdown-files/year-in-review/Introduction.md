# Gaming Years in Review

After I started writing my top 100 games list, I felt like there were more games I wanted to write things about. Then it kind of turned into this idea that I might as well write about them while they're still fresh on my mind. It's a little daunting to review almost every game you've played, but I only plan to do it going forward, and a little review at a time after playing something is manageable.

To be clear, these are all games I played in a certain year, not just games released that year.
