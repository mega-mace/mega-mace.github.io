# Best Games of 2022

## Elden Ring

This is the game that made me question this whole project, as it landed here by default, being the only game I've played from this year as of this writing. There are other potential interesting releases I might get around to eventually, but I think this will be generally be remembered as a year the industry really felt the effects of Covid. Even a look at the Wikipedia page of top reviewed games for the year reveals a lot of re-releases of various forms.

Whether it would have made it onto the list regardless is hard for me to say. I put Dark Souls down for 2011, so I don't have a complete distaste for the genre. But when I played Elden Ring (keeping in mind I haven't played all the intervening entries yet), I couldn't help but feel that From Software hasn't changed much in over a decade. And really, why should they? Their games have a big following, and I'm not the core audience, even if I like them somewhat.

The big change with ER is that it is structurally open world, as it still leans on the typical FromSoft combat mechanics. The advantage of an open world is there is less rote grinding, as you can just go to a new area and gain runes that way, but in true FromSoft fashion, they are wise to the player's tricks. The bosses have so much more dynamic movesets that I had an even more difficult time than usual trying to keep up, and grinding can only save you so much.

To me, the best thing about FromSoft's approach is not the notorious difficulty but the other ways it rejects AAA norms. Their games are hard to truly hate as a result, but a certain point you have to ask yourself how much you can tolerate repeating certain sections over and over again. Many people appreciated this kind of difficulty in games of the past, but it's one thing when it's used to stretch out a four hour long game, not ones that push 100.

I don't think an easy mode is the answer, but I feel like FromSoft games tend to be about 10% harder than they need to be. Yet I see a small but loud minority who think even the _current_ difficulty of their games is too easy. I'm sure FromSoft isn't capitulating to those prideful, gatekeeping gamers specifically, but they have stuck to their guns on challenge, and as a result made some interesting experiences perhaps at the expense of a wider audience. Or at least I thought so, until ER became a true megahit. Maybe that is a result of the lean 2022, or I'm wrong and this review can be summed up as: "It's too hawwwwd!"
