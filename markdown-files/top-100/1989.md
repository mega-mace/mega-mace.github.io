# Best Games of 1989

## Tetris

Well let’s just get it out of the way: Yes, Tetris is really a 1984 game, but it seemed worthy of mention. While I do enjoy a good round of Pac-Man, Galaga and the like, I think Tetris is the only game before 1985 that would make my top 100 if I was doing this year-agnostic. A listing under 1989 felt appropriate for a few reasons. First, this turned out to be a surprisingly thin year (given it occurs right around the NES's peak), so I didn't feel anything else was really deserving. Secondly, the Game Boy version was a landmark release that helped bring it to a wider audience… and for good measure, there were even two different NES versions this year.

As for the game itself, Tetris has endured due to its simple yet nuanced gameplay, which has been gradually expanded upon over the years without stripping the game of its core appeal. Add in the fact that it works with nearly any kind of visuals and music and that’s a recipe for an endlessly-re-releasable hit. So many other puzzle games that involve colorful falling objects on a grid have come along since, and while they are fun in their own right, nothing I’ve played has reached the heights of Tetris.
