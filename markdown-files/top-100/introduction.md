# My Top 100 Games of All Time, By Year

The topic of top 100 games ever is one I’ve thought on a lot, as well as games by year. So why not smash them together? Thinking up 100 of the best games is no small task, but it can get easier when thinking of a way to comb through them sequentially. A chronological listing might not be my _truest_ 100 games, but it’s probably a decent approximation. The other benefit I get out of going by year is that it gets me thinking about games against their contemporaries, rather than trying to place games from all over the spectrum against one another. 

I’m starting from 1985 for this. Why 1985? Well, mainly the North American release of the NES—and I think many would agree whether they personally like Nintendo that the year was a major turning point in gaming. I _do_ like Nintendo though, so I might be biased. Certainly I am aware that this list will have a _lot_ of Nintendo games, but hey, I only had so much gaming time/budget growing up, and I can only list what I actually know.

Obviously this means each year must have at least one entry, but I’m also imposing an upper limit of five games for a given year.

I determine year by original release date for its earliest region. DLC, expansions, continuous content, remasters, etc. can factor into my evaluating the quality of a game, but I still count the year of the original game’s release, regardless of when these updates came out. The one exception would be if, at my discretion, I find a re-release to be a significant enough change to consider a separate game.

No fan games, mods, hacks, etc. I do appreciate the talent, creativity and dedication that goes into these, but I feel like it’s almost a separate category, and simply put I just haven’t really played enough to include them anyway. 

Each review will be limited to 500 words or less per game, barring an _extra_ exceptional game. Exercising brevity is important! And with 100 games, a max word count of 50,000 (excluding the intro) is already a lot.

There will definitely not be any sort of overall ranking, but the enthusiasm level of the review should give some idea. Occasionally I'll emphasize the very best games explicitly, as well as call out fringe entries.

## Methodology

For the most part, I went through year by year looking at the Wikipedia page of that year in gaming. Those wikis don’t list all games, but include most significant ones, which generally encompasses what I’ve played anyway. For more recent years, since I have those consoles hooked up, it was easy enough to just browse through my libraries on those consoles. Then I made an initial pass, putting down most games that are at least borderline good-great, knowing that some will need to be eliminated later. Some of them I eliminated from the list entirely, but others made it in as honorable mentions. I went through a push-pull of deciding what could absolutely go, what absolutely had to stay, gradually working from both ends until I landed on 100.

## Criteria and Review Content

It should probably go without saying, but there is no real criteria for what constitutes a top 100 game, other than I enjoyed it at some level and thought it “feels” right to put it. If you want a review of the most influential or impactful games, so read IGN or Kotaku or something. This is more about reflection than recommendation. That being said, of course I do sometimes value a game on impact and influence, and emphasize such. Hopefully the content of the reviews tends to reflect why I place importance on a particular game. I fully admit that the quality of the reviews varies, as the words come more easily for some games than others. Depending on the review I might talk about memories around playing it; its place in a broader series or genre; how it reflects industry trends, and so on. Sometimes they are a bit more critical rather than completely glowing, but rest assured that I do like everything here. Each review is intended to be readable standalone, but I also liberally make references to other reviews, in painting a broader picture of my tastes. Lastly, I don’t waste a lot of words on explaining what the game is (unless I feel it helps contextualize it), so this assumes some reader familiarity; again, that’s more IGN’s job.

## Version History

The first complete version of the list took me around a year to write, due to a combination of the extensiveness of writing 100 reviews, the changes I made to the list over the year as I played new contenders, and mostly my tendency towards procrastination.

Initially, I planned to update the list each year, but I eventually decided against it. Even before I completed it, I hit a point where I was content enough that I didn't want to change the entries anymore, even if I did play a new game that probably deserved it. The reasons for this are:

1. If I place new games on the list, it means taking one off, which ostensibly would be the 100th-best game. But then this becomes an exercise in precise ranking and comparing between eras, which this was not supposed to be.
2. I dislike the idea of having to keep up with each successive new year. Some years I might not play a truly worthy game, at least not _in_ its release year.
3. I came up with the idea of a "Year in Review" after I started this list, giving me a place to dump my more detailed thoughts, which was kind of the main point of this.

I do still plan to make updates to this, but any games I want to add will go under Honorable Mentions, and I won't go beyond 2023 unless I feel like it. Initially I conceived of the HMs as sub-100 games, but with this new approach, it'll be a mixture of those as well as games that probably would be top 100 if I re-ranked things. At this point I prefer to think of "top 100" as a statement of quality than a literal ranking. 

Of course, there might also be updates for little fixes or rewrites of existing entries.
