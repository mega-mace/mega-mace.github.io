# Best Games of 2003

## Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow

I'm surprised I couldn't find many picks for 2003, but if Symphony of the Night could make it on here, then Aria of Sorrow is certainly worthwhile. That isn't to say that AoS is the better game of the two, but if it's not, it's really close. This was the third attempt at a GBA Castlevania, and while I liked the first two enough, it was clear that Konami finally figured it out. Though it can't match up to SotN in terms of graphics and sound, it plays great with the limited GBA controls. The map design and progression are far more cohesive. 

Now I realize I have very little to say about it, but there are so many Metroid style games on here and you can only say so much about satisfying senses of progression, etc. It's also a great testament to the game that it's hard to think of anything negative either. Its biggest offense is, clearly, being a bit unmemorable overall. It definitely doesn't have the same coolness factor of SotN, but it's so well-executed that it's easy to take for granted.
